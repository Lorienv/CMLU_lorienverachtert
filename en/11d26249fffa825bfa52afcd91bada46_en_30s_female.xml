I had always been a safe driver and I didn't understand why it was necessary for me to put money on an insurance policy that I probably won't need. But the agent was very nice and he made me realize why it was important to get insured.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blurty.com%2Ftalkpost.bml%3Fjournal%3Darielwaterwww.25%26amp%3Bitemid%3D1760"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://www.blurty.com/talkpost.bml?journal=arielwaterwww.25&amp;itemid=1760&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.atom.com%2FPost%2FGet-the-popular-car-insurance-Austin-texas-policy%2F03EFBFFFF0245B5040008015A0888%3Fref_title%3Drodrigohouse717%26amp%3Bref_url%3Dhttp%253a%252f%252fcommunity.atom.com%252fprofile%252f004B545020245B50400010245B504%252fContent%252fPost%252fMyPosts2.aspx%26amp%3Bref_ucid%3D04B545020245B50400010245B504"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://community.atom.com/Post/Get-the-popular-car-insurance-Austin-texas-policy/03EFBFFFF0245B5040008015A0888?ref_title=rodrigohouse717&amp;ref_url=http%3a%2f%2fcommunity.atom.com%2fprofile%2f004B545020245B50400010245B504%2fContent%2fPost%2fMyPosts2.aspx&amp;ref_ucid=04B545020245B50400010245B504&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailystrength.org%2Fpeople%2F716222%2Fjournal"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://www.dailystrength.org/people/716222/journal&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;He explained that I could file a claim if my car gets stolen or if I get involved in an accident as it is very costly in the USA to get the car fixed without insurance.
