You have to pass through the rain to appreciate the sunshine. I have learned so many lessons in this life. No one wants to be around you when you are down,no one wants to even listen or understand you,especially the people you relly on most. But one this is for sure,this has brought me closer to God and if I had to do it again,I would not change a thing. I am stronger now. When God eventually lifts me up, i will know who my true friends are.Dont love me now coz am down and full of shit and dont love me later when things are looking up for me. God bless you all.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
