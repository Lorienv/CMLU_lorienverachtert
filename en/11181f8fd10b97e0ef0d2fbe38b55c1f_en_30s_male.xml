&lt;br /&gt;; 
&lt;br /&gt;;So as to help the 2012 Acura TL Review Type S get more and show off more in its performance, Acura has built the vehicle with a six speed manual transmission system which is close-ratio. Plus, the car also has got a speed sensitive electric power steering system that would give drivers that sporty driving effect and powerful control.		</conversation>		<conversation id="636a78c713d0c1de20762cd82a05935b">			Mercedes initially began manufacturing its executive dimensions E-Class motor vehicles inside the 1950's.
