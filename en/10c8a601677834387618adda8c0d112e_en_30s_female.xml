Most women will experience this condition at least once in their lives. Quite often the infections continue to come back more than once in a year, for some people. There are many causes for yeast infections and a great many are not sexually related. Proper and serious treatment is the way you should always deal with Candida infections. If you are experiencing recurring infections, then you need to start doing some investigative work. A medical condition that won't go away needs a solution and maybe that won't happen until the doctor is seen.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;In almost every part of the body, on the skin, is where the Candida yeast fungus lives, as we have already told you. In order for an over-growth, or infection, condition to occur, there must be a certain number and types of contributing factors. The skin is a very good protector for the body, and unless for some reason it is broken down, the organism will not get in.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;For the fungus to thrive, there are other factors that must be present also. A skin infection by Candida will take on the appearance of a rash that is reddish and simply looks flat. You will find edges that are sharp and have scalloped texture when you check your rash. The main rash will be larger, but smaller rashes will also be found. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;A compromised immune system is one category that makes you a big risk for yeast infects.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;There are many conditions, like an over-growth of Candida, that could affect the body when it is in a weakened state. People, like patients with HIV, have a weakened immune system, and that causes yeast over-growth, and that makes various organs function abnormally. Very many AIDS patients suffer from esophagitis which is a yeast infection that looks like thrush. This infection passes through the body producing ulcers, starting in the mouth and working its way down the throat to the intestinal tract.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Being generalized in the whole body is what can happen in some instances as the yeast spreads. This is something that is very rare when it does happen. This widespread and systemic infection by yeast is fatal in up to approximately 75% of cases. Whenever you have had a yeast infection, and it won't go away, or it keeps coming back, it might be a more serious medical condition, so you should be concerned. If you have yeast infections that keep coming back, it is very important to make an appointment to visit with your doctor. Yeast infections are not something to ignore and hope they will go away on their own, because they can result in serious complications. If the common symptoms of vaginal yeast infection are something you are experiencing you can either choose self-medication or consult your doctor. However, you should see your doctor for safe and effective treatment if you are pregnant, and there are other medical conditions that warrant professional intervention. Your doctor will take a small scrape of tissue so a simple test and laboratory analysis can be done. A trained technician will identify the organism under a microscope once the scrape sample has been cultured. It doesn't take a long time for that process and it is the best way to get an accurate diagnosis. Any person really must take any suspected yeast infection symptoms very seriously. Infection involving the sexual organs for either genders will become painful and pose a serious threat. Also, because the infection can be spread through sexual contact, there is a responsibility to protect others as well. There is the extreme danger of causing damage to skin or tissue during sexual activity that could possibly introduce yeast into the bloodstream. In many cases, death is the result of a systemic yeast infection.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hc2lhbmF2ZS5jb20veW91cl9wYWdlL2Jsb2cvdmlld19wb3N0aW5nLmh0bWw/cGlkPTY3NzE0MTkmYW1wO3Byb2ZpbGVfaWQ9NTUyOTY1NzcmYW1wO3Byb2ZpbGVfbmFtZT1kb21pbmlja2tlcnI5MjImYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NTUyOTY1NzcmYW1wO3VzZXJuYW1lPWRvbWluaWNra2VycjkyMg__" target="_blank"&gt;;Get Clearer Skin With These Clever Strategies!&lt;/a&gt;;, &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2RvbWluaWNra2VycjkyMi5kZXZpYW50YXJ0LmNvbS9qb3VybmFsLzQ1NDA0Mzg5Lw__" target="_blank"&gt;;Ultimately, Acne Suggestions That Function Like No Other&lt;/a&gt;;		</conversation>		<conversation id="c9dbe5bdf8c56e0c687337e7a4ba108f">			There are very often no differences at all between the genders when it comes to vanity and hairstyles.
