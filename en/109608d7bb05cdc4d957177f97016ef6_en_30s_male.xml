I feel privileged to live in this era of fulfillment of JFK's dream. This is because, the internet has managed to bring us together in a way unprecedented. we are able to lough, cry and share  many things together without any prejudice whatsoever. the only challenge we still face is the  translation of many languages to one language that all of us could communicate without any barrier. it is my strong belief that sooner than later some genius would solve this jinx. otherwise , we are only relevant in this world when we contribute, not only to each others welfare but to the welfare to the generations to come. welcome all.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
