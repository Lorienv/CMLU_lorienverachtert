&lt;br /&gt;;Influences on the Value of a Book Collection
&lt;br /&gt;; 
&lt;br /&gt;;Collecting books can be an gratifying hobby. Some people collect books for fun, others keep a collection of all books that they have read, and some collect books to make money. Determining how much money a book is worth can be a tricky task; this article will outline a few factors that influence a bookâ€™s worth.
&lt;br /&gt;; 
&lt;br /&gt;;This might come as a surprise to some inexperienced collectors, but if a book is old, that does not necessarily mean it is valuable. Defining the term â€œoldâ€? is a problem in itself. You might have a book that was printed in 1940 that seems to be very old by your personal standards, but that certainly is not very impressive in the world of book collecting.
&lt;br /&gt;; 
&lt;br /&gt;;Some people tend to think that age and value can be directly proportional, which is also not necessarily true. The demand for and rarity of a book are most important in determining its worth, and the age of any particular book does not always influence the value of the book. The book collecting industry is not immune to the powers of supply and demand. Keeping this in mind, if you have a book that is very old and is also the only book of its kind, it is worth exactly zero dollars if nobody in the world wants to read it or buy it for their collection.
&lt;br /&gt;; 
&lt;br /&gt;;One very tangible way to measure a certain bookâ€™s worth relative to similar books is by examining the physical condition of the book. A book that is not in good condition, even if it is very old and rare, will not be worth as much compared to the same book that was kept in better condition. Keeping the original dust jacket on a used book can also be important to its value; a book without the original jacket or with a tattered or stained jacket is worth less than the same book with a properly preserved original dust jacket.
&lt;br /&gt;; 
&lt;br /&gt;;Another thing that could increase the value of a used book is an authorâ€™s signature. One thing to be wary of, though, is whether the signature was printed in many copies of the book by the typesetter or was actually penned by the author. A printed signature would not add value to a book, but an authentic penned signature on an already sought-after book would increase the value.
&lt;br /&gt;; 
&lt;br /&gt;;Another consideration important to the value of a book is whether it is a first edition pressing of the book. If you have a book from the first printing and a copy of the same book but from the second edition, the value of the first edition version of the book is much higher.
&lt;br /&gt;; 
&lt;br /&gt;;Determining the value of any book is not an easy task. Collecting books can be a great hobby, whether you are a newcomer to the industry or seasoned expert.
