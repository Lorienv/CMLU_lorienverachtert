&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;i was seeing a bloke called dave and my now ex mate was seeing his flat mate.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Whenever i stayed there with dave this ex mate of mine would be trotting around in just a thong or french knickers and not much else. this girl says she very self conscious about her body, doesn't seem it when she tarts around like that.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;they could all see i was pissed off about something, but i didn't bother saying anything as i figured maybe she'd get the hint from my sarcastic comments such as, &quot;have you ran out of clothes&quot; or &quot;not everybody wants to see you half naked all the time&quot;. she didn't get it.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;i left there and told dave that i wan't coming back that night cus i was too stressed and upset staying there for now. he didn't give a rats ass so i'm glad i found that out before it got really serious.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;then my ex mate sent me messages saying what the hell is my problem as i've been in a strop. i ignored it cus i get too worked up and don't like to argue i prefer to get it over quickly and just head but somebody. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;i'm now no longer talking to any of them. please somebody give me your opinion on the situation as i don't think it's right to be like that? is it just me cus i find that hard to believe		</conversation>		<conversation id="f3d1d9b5197fc131ef4f92076482fe6f">			check out SweetLittle_T on facebox as shes the girl that split me and my ex up cus she was fooling around with him behind my back. if ya side with me then please leave a comment and if ya feel like leaving a not so polite one her profile that's fine. yea it's petti but i'm tired as i just finished a night shift and it's pissed me off xx		</conversation>		<conversation id="9e6a89a64f5ff756499e7a35b55dae0d">			hiya, i'm feeling good today. got rid of people who cause my problems and getting compliments. so thanx to everybody who left a comment on my pics xx		</conversation>		<conversation id="3021e99425891f1fa70e2c22c120abc0">			im so fed up and bored!		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
