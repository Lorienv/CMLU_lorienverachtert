&lt;br /&gt;Summer and flowers are for away, gloomy old winter is king today
&lt;br /&gt;Buds do not grow, and the sun does not shine; what shall I do for a Valentine?
&lt;br /&gt;I searched the gardens through and through for a bud to tell my love so true.
&lt;br /&gt;But buds are asleep, and blossoms are dead, and the snow beats down on my poor little head.
&lt;br /&gt;So, little loveliest guy of mine, here is my heartâ€¦ For your Valentine.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
