Make up your mind that today is going to be an incredible one. Not every one will think, act and speak like you. A little tolerance goes a long way. Remember to say: I love you to those you love. For everything we have missed, we have gained something. It is your life to live, be who you really are		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
