&lt;br /&gt;;home from the movies. The boy sensed
&lt;br /&gt;;there was something wrong because of
&lt;br /&gt;;the painful silence they shared
&lt;br /&gt;;between them that night. The girl then
&lt;br /&gt;;asked the boy to pull over because she
&lt;br /&gt;;wanted to talk. She told him that her
&lt;br /&gt;;feelings had changed &amp; that it was
&lt;br /&gt;;time to move on. A silent tear slid
&lt;br /&gt;;down his cheek as he slowly reached
&lt;br /&gt;;into his pocket &amp; passed her a folded
&lt;br /&gt;;note. At that moment, a drunk driver
&lt;br /&gt;;was speeding down that very same
&lt;br /&gt;;street. He swerved right into the
&lt;br /&gt;;drivers seat, killing the boy.
&lt;br /&gt;;Miraculously, the girl survived.
&lt;br /&gt;;Remembering the note, she pulled it
&lt;br /&gt;;out &amp; read it.
&lt;br /&gt;;&quot;Without your love, I would die.&quot; &lt;img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /&gt;;		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
