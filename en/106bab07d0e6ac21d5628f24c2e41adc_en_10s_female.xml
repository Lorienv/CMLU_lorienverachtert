Storey, CELLFOOD is actually a proprietary blend of 129 elements.It truly is an anti aging supplement  that he claimed could possibly be the answer to illness on the planet. Everett Storey is credited for that improvement from the drinking water -splitting technology amongst other good inventions. Throughout the second planet war ,he witnessed his innovations being employed to create the hydrogen bomb and being a  humanitarian, he so desired to do some thing excellent for humanity so he developed CELLFOOD.&lt;br /&gt;;The exact same drinking water splitting technologies that he invented ,that was being used within the H-bomb's fusion cause was integrated in to the CELLFOOD technologies. He thus developed an oxygen treatment based on the deuterium ions to self-sustain a catalytic kind reaction where our inside physique h2o is split into oxygen and hydrogen.&lt;br /&gt;; CELLFOOD  , the result of 42 years of study, is made from your best plant substances, effective at keeping its powerful components in complete resolution, providing them to each and every mobile in the human body. This miraculous system supports and enhances dietary biochemical activities and delivers to our diet what modern day residing and technologies have stripped away. It consists of 78 trace minerals,34 enzymes,17amino acids, electrolytes, and nascent (newly made) oxygen and hydrogen as by products--all naturally occurring substances and crucial for the body's lots of bio-chemical function,in a type that is certainly quickly absorbed by the cellls from the physique.&lt;br /&gt;;Dr. Otto Warburg renowned bio-chemist and 1931 nobel prize laureate has proven that most cancers cells can't develop inside a large oxygen atmosphere.

In 1997 CELLFOOD was unanimously voted by the Inventors Club of The united states to obtain the 1997 Sophisticated Technologies Award presented by the International Hall of Fame in Atlanta GA. CELLFOOD received this award simply because(1) it really is exceptional potential to generate both nascent oxygen and hydrogenised the physique, resulting in simultaneous cleansing and building of body cells and tissues and (2) its exclusive ability to sustain 78 minerals in liquid colloidal suspension. CELLFOOD is really a highly concentrated tremendous energised proprietary formulation containing 78 ionic colloidal trace elements and minerals(34 from fossilized vegetation taken from virgin earth and forty four from the thoroughly clean southern seas surrounding New Zealand, unrefined and nevertheless containing trace components!) mixed with 34 enzymes,17 amino acids, dissolved oxygen all suspended in a resolution of Deuterium Sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;;The nutrients in CELLFOOD are each ionic and colloidal in form.
