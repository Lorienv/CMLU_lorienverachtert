&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't have to ask what true love is
&lt;br /&gt;when i look into your eyes and see that im know and understood,
&lt;br /&gt;As i've never been before.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't have to ask if it's real or if it's meant to be,
&lt;br /&gt;When you take me hand and wisper you beleive in me.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't have to question the feelings my heart tells me,
&lt;br /&gt;Because my mind and spirit know you're the right one for me
&lt;br /&gt;just as much as my eyes do.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when you take me into your arms,
&lt;br /&gt;I know i don't have to look any longer
&lt;br /&gt;for the priceless thing everyone dreams of,
&lt;br /&gt;and too few find...
&lt;br /&gt;that true deep connection,
&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;one and only&quot;; kind of love...
&lt;br /&gt;the &quot;;soul mate&quot;; kind.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I've found true love with you,
&lt;br /&gt;and i want to do everything to make all your dreams come true too.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
