This house would also have us only a few doors away from good friends.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a christian, can you please pray for this to happen.  There are many reasons why my child and I need to move from our current house, the distance from my job is only 1 of many.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanking You in advance.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAY GOD BLESS YOU FOR ALL ETERNITY

&lt;br /&gt;We are very happy in our new home.
&lt;br /&gt;Talk about moving horrors though.  Does anyone want to exchange moving problems?   &lt;img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /&gt;		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
