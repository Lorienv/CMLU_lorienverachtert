That place is called the &quot;;HABITAT&quot;;. for a tree- when uprooted from the ground will take but few munuites to start fading, a fish will die on land. In your Habitat you dont strugle:- a bird never strugles to fly nor do lizards strugle to run against the wall. So it is for every MAN (both male and female) who makes THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD their HABITAT, They  shall live the supernatural life just like Christ did.
