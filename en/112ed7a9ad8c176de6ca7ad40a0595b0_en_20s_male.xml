I began to t[/b]hink at parties now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to think alone - &quot;;to relax,&quot;; I told myself - but I knew it wasn't true. Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself. I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read writings of Plato, Saint Augustine of Hippo, Jesus Christ, and Aristotle. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, &quot;;What is it exactly we are doing here?&quot;;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things weren't going so great at home either. One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother's.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, &quot;;Skippy, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job.&quot;; This gave me a lot to think about.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came home early after my conversation with the boss. &quot;;Honey, &quot;; I confessed, &quot;;I've been thinking...&quot;; &quot;;I know you've been thinking,&quot;; she said, &quot;;and I want a divorce!&quot;; &quot;;But Honey, surely it's not that serious.&quot;; &quot;;It is serious,&quot;; she said, lower lip aquiver. &quot;;You think as much as college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!&quot;; &quot;;That's a faulty syllogism,&quot;; I said impatiently, and she began to cry. I'd had enough. &quot;;I'm going to the library,&quot;; I snarled as I stomped out the door.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I headed for the library, in the mood for Clinton's latest book &quot;;Family Morals in America&quot;;. Listening to a PBS station on the radio, I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn't open. The library was closed. Later, I realized that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night. As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. &quot;;Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?&quot;; it asked. You probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinker's Anonymous poster.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was &quot;;Jerry Spinger&quot;; talking about the song &quot;;I'm bad&quot;; by Michael Jacks. Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting. Life just seemed .. more bland .. without purpose or meaning, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking, and avoided thoughts about the meaning of life and my future. I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home and the office. Now I stare for hours at the T.V. and receive my daily dose of brainwashing instead of contemplating the mysteries of life.
