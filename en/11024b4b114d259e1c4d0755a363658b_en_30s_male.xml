&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Thanks for dropping in.  
&lt;br /&gt;;This non smoking business is driving me crazy but I think I have a good plan and should stick with it.
&lt;br /&gt;;The plan is to quit smoking and start again when I retire so I can blow all the retirement money away on cigars and other useless entertainment.  What do you think?
&lt;br /&gt;;Anyway, have a look aground.  Leave a message if you want, you don't have to be nice but please try.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Cheers,
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Harry DaGreek		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
