&lt;br /&gt;;To help me cope with anything
&lt;br /&gt;;If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
&lt;br /&gt;;You can take the future even if you fail
&lt;br /&gt;;I believe in angels
&lt;br /&gt;;Something good in everything I see
&lt;br /&gt;;I believe in angels
&lt;br /&gt;;When I know the time is right for me
&lt;br /&gt;;I'll cross the stream - I have a dream
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I have a dream, a fantasy
&lt;br /&gt;;To help me through reality
&lt;br /&gt;;And my destination makes it worth the while
&lt;br /&gt;;Pushing through the darkness still another mile
&lt;br /&gt;;I believe in angels
&lt;br /&gt;;Something good in everything I see
&lt;br /&gt;;I believe in angels
&lt;br /&gt;;When I know the time is right for me
&lt;br /&gt;;I've crossed the stream - I have a dream
