Hundreds of such shows are broadcast to millions of viewers daily. Naija is not left out of the craze...BBN and The Intern would do.
&lt;br /&gt;Many folks identify and enjoy the show part of it. However the reality part is most intriguing to me, cause it reveals that real life has got a way to live it. Its called STRATEGY.
&lt;br /&gt;Forget the cameras in &quot;;houses&quot;;. Forget the &quot;;fakeness&quot;;. You can only show for so long! When it comes right down to it, you will still need a game plan to ensure you come tops. Ask Adetola Afolabi Williams and Ayo Oguntubi how it went at the Intern. Men! Those two slugged it out.
&lt;br /&gt;Just like reality shows, we've got to apply strategies in real life. Otherwise we won't be able to surmount some challenges. Abi how do you handle a difficult boss? A troublesome surbodinate? A crazy and sadistic and moody and i-too-know colleague? Like the type I have here in my office. Haba! I know some women are witches and can be gruelling to work with (GOD don use them teach me patience), but this one! She is will match anyone fang for fang. Hisses.
&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, my strategies in life and my office are; Honesty, Truthfulness, Openness, Being myself (sounds familiar huh), a high self- concept and a choice to be happy whatever happens!
&lt;br /&gt;OK. I know strategies have to be dynamic, so maybe I could use more suggestions? Thank you.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
