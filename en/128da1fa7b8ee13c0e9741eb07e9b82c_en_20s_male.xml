My issue here is to trust to other people, even to myself. But I’ve grown the best out of this ridiculous life. With all troubles in my life I prefer making it simple yet tough. I don’t agree that hate does have significant connections with revenge.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I have tasted some of bitterness and cold happiness in part of my life journey. Lost some best friend, friends and love ones, however I felt enough with the weep and grief of my old-happy-miserable life.
&lt;br /&gt;; I longed for real journey with someone who thinks can handle this sarcastic middleman dude. I can be so freakin emotional, with art in my head and dreams in my eyes.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I always remember a past as my lucid day dream. Once they where there you cannot erase them. Co’z there’s a lesson we all have to learn, a process is far more important than the result itself. We all get hurt with sweet memories, even though they leave pain; it’s still sweet as before.
