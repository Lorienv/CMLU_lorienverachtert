With simple set up process, there are live broadcasts with absolutely no impact on the existing internet connection.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;There are ways around some of the restrictions â€“ using Foxy proxy to make iPlayer think live in the UK, and having a UK iTunes account so as to access pod casts that way. But this is breaking the rules because the &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53YXRjaC1iYmMtaXBsYXllci5jb20v" target="_blank"&gt;;BBC abroad&lt;/a&gt;;seems to treat everyone beyond the British Isles differently.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;There are other low cost services that offer BBC abroad. These low cost services give only 1 UK VPN connection that they oversell, you will find a lot of buffering and connection problems as many people are trying to use the same connection in peak times.

Members also have access to discounts on other packages. Every new member has free lifetime access to members area.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;This is a much more expensive route, as payment is needed to make for the TV subscription as well; however the quality of picture is just amazing. For an expat living abroad and willing to watch BBC abroad online it really is the best option, there is no other way to watch BBC for instance.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The cheapest option but not really the simplest is to connect back to BBC iplayer, what is needed is forming a simple VPN or SSH tunnel back to a computer in the UK. Proxy settings can then be modified in the browser and IP address will seem to be based in the UK. This method works very well if there is some technical knowledge available and access to a machine in the UK, one of the issues is that a good upload speed from the UK machine is needed or the connection will be extremely slow.
