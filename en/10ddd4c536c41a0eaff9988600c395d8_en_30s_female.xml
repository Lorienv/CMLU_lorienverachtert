There are times I would like to go back just so I can be with someone, but it is fair to be with someone just to avaoid lonliness? I don't think so.  I know in time things will get better, it's just hard going through this right now.  It makes you wonder, is it better to be with someone who puts you down, even though they say it's a joke, or be alone.  Neither side of the coin is all that shiny is it??		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
