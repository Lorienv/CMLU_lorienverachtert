The Reasons Why Victoria Beckham Choose &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvYnJvb2NoZXM_" target="_blank"&gt;????&lt;/a&gt; This novel tells a story that King Lear who is aging, doted, opinionated and improvident gives his land to his fictitious eldest daughter Regan and his second daughter Goneril, but he expels his youngest daughter Cordelia our of the country since she is so honest, frank and kind that she refuses to make an insincere speech to prove her love to her father king. Be expelled from her country, Kedilixia had no choice but to leave for France with her lover, King of France. King Lear remained the honor of the King and one hundred attendants, preparing for living in his two daughters' palaces in turn to enjoy the evening of his life. Who would have guessed his two daughters showed their true colors after they achieved the goal, and King Lear was evicted from his palace to suffer hardships, drifting from place to place homeless and miserable. The youngest daughter crusaded against two sisters after she knew King Lear's tragic experience, but unfortunately she failed. Finally she was captured and cut her throat. King Lear also died in sorrow and anger. Of course, the two bad daughter's fate are woeful.Whatâ€™s New? Options of &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvc3dhcm92c2tpY3J5c3RhbC1uZWNrbGFjZXM_" target="_blank"&gt;????????????&lt;/a&gt; Are Delivered in Oslo
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems Kind Lear deserves this sad ending for his stupid and vain doings which result in Cordelia’s death. Springâ€™s Fairest &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvcGVhcmwtYnJhY2VsZXRz" target="_blank"&gt;?????????&lt;/a&gt; Direction of Fashion By the way, suffering such miserable treatment is really the most unbearable one in his life, but what's worse for him is that his kindest daughter dies before him. However, we need to consider the fact that himself is an ordinary person just like us. If he was this stubborn when he was young, how could he keep his throne and govern the country? However, because of his high status, he long lived in the palace where all the people eagerly followed and flattered him and depended on his right and wrong, and on his like and dislike. Over a long period, he was like an addict. For him, flattery and adulation became necessities in his life and he could not live without encomiastic speech. When he lost the throne, power, and went through many hardships, he reestablished human nature. His dying lament is not for the momentum and the emperor's authority, but for his little daughter who was turned out of the court and cursed by him. But he could not call her back from her eternal sleep. Because of such experience, he understood the most precious thing was true feelings which could not be bought by money and power. When he was happily lost in the flattery from the two elder daughters, the youngest daughter didn't flatter him at the same time and was brave enough to answer him back, which had offended the king who was so angry that he drove her out of the country.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young daughter Cordelia was kind,naive and filial as well as obstinate and emotional.And this made her have not prepared for her father even she knew her sisters' true minds. It is true that men should stick to their principles, but in most cases, speaking is more important than just action as it can help you express clearly what you think. She was fortunate, too. She got a true love from her husband because she owned nothing. This was the thing that her two sisters would never have or ever had. She was living in love all the time. But at the same time, she is impulsive. Because of her father's miserable sufferings from her two bad sisters, she sent the army to suppress them, with the result of failing and dying in the jail. Isn't she impulsive? She should take action when the time was ripe even if she couldn't wait with a kind heart. However, she declared the fight before she was well prepared. Therefore, it is normal that she failed at last.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the story happened in a remote ancient country, it has many exemplifications in our real life. We all like people who say honeyed words and praising words to us, but the result turns out that they are just the people who hurt us. This is not precisely the condemnation of those who keeps poison in the honey of the conspirators? In real life, phenomenon and essence, appearance and content tend to vary so greatly, so we can not lose sense because of the phenomenon and the appearance of to be the next King Lear. &quot;;What is shining is not all gold!&quot;; There is a concept and standard of good and evil, false and true in our hearts. No one can tell them when born, and it is not possible for us to have a good result as the story in the book. We can really identify good or bad only after going through this. We can not lose the sense of discerning because of our desire, and we should restrain the nature of loving sweet. Withour the bitter taste, how can we know the sweet taste?		</conversation>		<conversation id="df1a87ea4c843d076097fbb0b82920cb">			In times of a blur future, the best approaches to develop home furnishing markets are innovation and creativity, which have always been the footstone of MAISON&amp;OBJET's development strategy.
