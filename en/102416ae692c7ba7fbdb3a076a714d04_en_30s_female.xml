In basic fact, there are many recommendations for overall power economy and an outbuilding like air conditioning is amongst the first attacked, it is recommended the use of traditional ventilation, which is made of background air ventilation entering the windows. Sure, this version is not really something for anyone, especially in winter, in the event the window open flame may be triggering a flu for many weeks. However, to consider the next most common among advantages and drawbacks related to the use of air fitness in the car and can you find the right solution for you.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Why not use ac in the car?&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;It's true. Use air conditioning in the car can increase consumption overall by 10% of vehicle, especially in packed cities. This rate is not the unaware, especially if you have a budget for fuel each week or month. Studies have shown that the typical or lower speed of 70 kilometers each hour, cars can be more efficient in terms of consumption and comfort by keeping car windows when aired down. So, for many current different types of roads (driving through the city, left for the mall, visiting family), the easiest may be to aeristesti car with ambient air-course, as long as being the environment and temperature will not make you sense uncomfortable or will not affect the proper functioning of your car. So, from spring to autumn, you may keep the car windows open when heat permits, and the consumer's car and he will remain at a lower level, more profitable to suit your needs.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;When it useful to use air health and fitness?&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;If you exceed the speed of 70-80 kilometers each hour, as is normal to happen in highway driving conditions, it is better to keep windows closed and use ac system of the car. The cars have higher fuel consumption by around 20%, if windows are open. Current slows the vehicle and do even more unstable, not to say even more awkward to handle. It is more prone to get sick if you drive with that windows down at high speed, so it's completely appropriate to make use of the air conditioning when driving at high speed.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Besides air conditioning, there are other solutions that you can ventilate the car and keep comfort in the car. First, the main fan of your car, if joined within, can ventilate the car quite nicely and can decrease the temperature of the car. Then, it can change the smell of the car, namely to get rid of &quot;flavors&quot; of fuel and air alleyways. It's best to use this setting to maximum, but you can decide on less intensive options if desired. Another quite simple method is to park the car within a parking lot or cool, if not possible, even in the shade. Car doors available and vent out again before the city if it's hot, you will benefit in terms of comfort, and fuel consumption will be reduced.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FlcmUtY29uZGl0aW9uYXRlLmNvbS5yby8_" target="_blank"&gt;;oferte aer conditionat&lt;/a&gt;;.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
