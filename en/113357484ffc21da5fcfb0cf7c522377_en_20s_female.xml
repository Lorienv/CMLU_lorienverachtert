Looks: HOT Hair, Light Eyes, TATTOOS, Piercings, Toned Body, Edgy but with Style. He's rough and tough during the day... not scared to wear some eye liner. Can be SPONTANEOUS. No PLAIN JANE... or should I say PLAIN JOHN...haha!? Confidence with a small taste of cockiness. High Maintenance is considered to be good if you know how to carry it. Realizing that taking care of yourself and your body are important... makes your mind more clear of your thoughts and less clutter. Stand out of a crowd... be real... be compassionate... be open-minded...be someone unique and different... &quot;INTRIGUING&quot;!!! 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Intelligence: SPEAK if you know what your talking about... if not, don't bother. Have goals... DO whatever you feel that you can be the best in. Follow your Dreams. My boyfriend.. I look up to him. The most intelligent person I know. If you are anything like him... you might win some points. Don't be someone your not. BE yourself. No matter what you will get HATED on through your life. All that does is make you a stronger and more independent, intellectual human being that has something more to offer than the one that just brought you down. It makes you contribute more for what you believe in and teaches you to work your ass off that much harder. You OWN yourself and can be whatever your heart and soul desires. NO ONE can take that away. Every single person has their own BEAUTY and TALENT... use it and failure will NEVER occur. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;It screams PERFECTION without an ounce of FEAR. Representation of that picture is strived for everyday and every minute.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
