&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Mostly People living in flats  are not maintaining their water tanks properly this results in lot of water wastage due to overflowing . they are not concerned because Monthly water charges are fixed. This is happening in all over Noida.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The ballcock is not working &amp; tanks are not covered , this results in silan in all houses &amp; rise of malaria &amp; dengue in noida.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;In Delhi MCD takes water charges on consumption basis &amp; there is inspection by MCD team every year to check whether water tanks are properly covered or not, whether water coolers are proper cleaned or not.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;We require support of all Noida residents in this regard.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
