Facial plastic surgery can be more complex than other body or breast procedures a plastic surgeon can perform, and may require more training and experience. Each patient is different so individualized procedures are required and different techniques may be implemented.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial rejuvenation procedures are often performed in patients who feel they look older than they actually are. Along with the natural process of aging, comes fine lines, wrinkles, and even sagging in the skin as it loses its elasticity. Sun damage can also be responsible for some of the visible skin damage in the face. For patients who have sagging skin along the jawline and forehead, a &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kb2N0b3JiaW5kZXIuY29tL3Byb2NfZmFjZWxpZnQuYXNw" target="_blank"&gt;Beverly Hills Facelift&lt;/a&gt; can help them look and feel younger and rejuvenated. A neck lift procedure may be performed in conjunction with a facelift procedure to not only rejuvenate the face, but the neck area as well. This can provide stunningly natural results for patients, allowing them to look just as they did 10 years ago.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from facial rejuvenation, some individuals desire to contour certain features in the face such as the chin and nose. The nose is often reshaped as it may be too large, wide, and long for surrounding facial features. With a Rhinoplasty procedure or &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kb2N0b3JiaW5kZXIuY29tL3Byb2Nfcmhpbm9wbGFzdHkuYXNw" target="_blank"&gt;Nose Job Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt; residents and out of town patients can have the nose refined and reshaped to compliment surrounding facial features.

This makes it hard to relate to people in the world who want to change a facial feature more than anything else.

However, anyone who struggles with a face they think is out of proportion knows how much it can affect self-esteem. You can buy great jeans or a well-fitted bra to disguises body problems, but there is little you can do to reduce the size of your nose or alter the look of your lips.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you struggle with a particular feature, you should not feel vain making a change. Some people are able to learn to live with a facial flaw. Other people place too much of their focus on the flawed feature and over the years, it wears away at their self-esteem. &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kb2N0b3JiaW5kZXIuY29t" target="_blank"&gt;Beverly Hills rhinoplasty&lt;/a&gt; might turn out to be more than just a great new nose.
