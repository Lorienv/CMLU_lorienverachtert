To make real top quality tracks you need to spend a large chunk of cash in a professional studio and all the necessary equipment, otherwise the results might be poor. However, it's very clear that not everybody is able to afford such items, so what exactly should most people do then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's becoming more and more popular nowadays to use a beat making software. These beat making applications can be downloaded from the internet and installed on your PC or Mac in only a few minutes. Occasionally you don't even have to install anything! Some of them are overpriced (not as overpriced as a studio of course) but normally speaking you may get pretty decent ones for under $40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue is that many these beat maker software programs are awfully bad quality and if you try and make your own rap beats with them, you'll be astounded how awful the sound is and it just doesn't sound proper. This is when things begin to get tough, because if you'd like to make rap music beats, but don't have the tools, then its game over?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sick rap beats is usually created together with the support of pc applications, and I've proof of that. Few months back, when I was searching for a beat maker program, I was lucky enough to stumble on a PC application that still amazes me, I know that you'll find nothing which could match it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application I got addicted to given that then is named DUBturbo, and I can guarantee that this will be your last software program to obtain before you get started producing your own beats. I can not believe you can get a fully functional octave keyboard with it, and drum machine, track sequencer, pre-made music and a lot more. It's primarily a total digital music workstation, if that's understandable to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The developer and vendor of the program is so optimistic in his solution, that he guarantees a sixty days money back, no hassle policy! It is usually an everyone wins scenario, and I really support DUBturbo to any person curious about creating music beats online, for the reason that it's just astounding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're ready to start your music career right now, then learn how to  make your own beats with DUBturbo   &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeyourownbeatwww.1.net%2Fbeat-maker%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://http://www.makeyourownbeatwww.1.net/beat-maker/&lt;/a&gt;  and have your first track ready in only ten minutes from now!		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
