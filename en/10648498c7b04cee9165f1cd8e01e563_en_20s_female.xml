Because of leverage, you can get 10%, 25%, even 100% on your money in a relatively short amount of time. However, there is a down side here. You can lose a whole lot of money and wipe out your account in no time at all if you risk too much. So what is a safe end up risk per trade? &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Well, a lot of it depends on your trading strategy. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;If you will be a long-term trader and use the big profits, then you'll likely need to let your trade run for quite a while. This means that there does exist the potential that that trade could go against you a lot before it turns available (if it truly does). So many long-term traders risk only. 5% of their bank account on each trade. A long-term trader would probably hardly every risk more than 2% and the max they would ever risk is 5%. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;If you are a short-term trader and make an effort to get in and out of your market fairly quickly, you might do OK to chance 2% - 5% of your capital. For me, even 5% is too big. I much rather prefer just 2%. Risking 2% allows people to trade confidently together with comfortably which helps relieve me in the emotional stress of trading. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;What? You say there is no emotional stress to dealing? Well there absolutely is usually, and it is probably this emotional stress which kills beginning traders a lot more than anything. Losing control of their emotions. Getting greedy and risking excessive. Getting scared and not taking a trade. Getting even and losing twice even though they lost in the beginning. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;That is the reason why it is so important to never risk too much on each trade. Trading ought to be relatively enjoyable, and it is much easier to enjoy trading when 50 % of your account doesn't depend on the market moving in your route. &lt;br /&gt;;.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3R5c29uZmxlbWluZzgyMS5qaWdzeS5jb20vZW50cmllcy9nZW5lcmFsL0V4cGVydC1UYWN0aWNzLUFib3V0LUN1cnJlbmN5LVRyYWRpbmctRXhwb3NlZA__" target="_blank"&gt;;Expert Methods Around Basic Currency Technical Analysis Uncovered&lt;/a&gt;;, &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9nc3Rlci5jb20vdHlzb25mbGVtaW5nODIxL2luc2lkZXItbWV0aG9kcy1vbi11bmNvdmVyZWQ_" target="_blank"&gt;;Core Secrets Concerning Currency Trading Unveiled&lt;/a&gt;;When you begin trading on the foreign exchange market it is a good idea to understand the principles first.
