&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're my sweet dream
&lt;br /&gt;You're my everything
&lt;br /&gt;I couldn't ask for more
&lt;br /&gt;Cause I have it all with you
&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing stronger
&lt;br /&gt;Then the way our love flows
&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to upset heaven
&lt;br /&gt;Cause without you I don't want to go
&lt;br /&gt;I want to be with you beyond the end of time
&lt;br /&gt;I'll die over and over befor leave you behind
&lt;br /&gt;I know that's not in my power
&lt;br /&gt;We all have to face that final hour
&lt;br /&gt;I'll go down on my knees
&lt;br /&gt;And beg the lord to let you stay
&lt;br /&gt;There's no doubt In my mine
&lt;br /&gt;I'll die when he take you away
&lt;br /&gt;When you're feeling down
&lt;br /&gt;I'm always there to make you feel better
&lt;br /&gt;You know you can hold me to my word and every letter
&lt;br /&gt;I'm like your Norah and my heart is your ark
&lt;br /&gt;I'm always sheltering you from the rain
&lt;br /&gt;I know I can't always be your Super Man
&lt;br /&gt;God knows
&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could protect you from life's pain
&lt;br /&gt;If I had a dime for every time that I've shown you I got your back
&lt;br /&gt;We would be rich
&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how you treat her life can be a bitch
&lt;br /&gt;We had more when we had less
&lt;br /&gt;You and I prepared for happiness
&lt;br /&gt;But with happiness comes stress
&lt;br /&gt;Through out it all we are truly blessed
&lt;br /&gt;Everyday we strive to do our best
&lt;br /&gt;You will be my sweet dream until we're laid to rest
