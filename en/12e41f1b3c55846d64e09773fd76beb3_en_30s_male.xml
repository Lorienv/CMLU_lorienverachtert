We must know OURSELVES (&quot;KNOW THYSELF&quot;&lt;img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /&gt;; to learn what we want and need sexually. Then we should instead have the will and self-assurance to communicate these desires to our partner, even when confronted with possible rejection. Also, we need to have relinquished some of the layers of narcissistic self-consciousness that will, when young, often have prevented us from being truly attuned to a new person's reality and needs. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Precisely what I'm saying is: good sex requires PSYCHOLOGICAL MATURITY (which we all have because we've lived for a while now and have learned some things along the way.) &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Mature lovers are more likely to experience not simply satisfying sex, but usually tend to experience sexual ecstasy. Certain states may occur in sex the location where the boundaries of do it yourself are suspended in merger with the &quot;other&quot;. This type of, well, self-transcendence, can open that channels to experiencing an awareness of of a broader, more universal connection. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Let's discover what the book says about &quot;ecstasy&quot;: rapturous excite; intense joy; mental transport or rapture from the contemplation of divine things; displacement; trance; a shared sense of being taken or moved out of one's self or one's normal condition, and entering a state of intensified feelings so powerful as to produce a trance-like dissociation from nearly the single effective emotion; this trance and rapture is associated with mystical exaltation. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Eastern societies routinely associate sexual ecstasy with spiritual enlightenment. Only in Western civilizations is there a chasm concerning sex and Goodness. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;So, it's all good, right? Everything from lowering your blood pressure to experiencing mystical exaltation points to the fact that sex is a good thing. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Nevertheless if it's such a good thing, why are so many people not having intercourse?.. or are controlled by various sexual dysfunctions, compulsions or perversions? &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Truth be told that few people will ever seize the means to explore the complete range of our sexual possibilities. One writer I read known those who achieve the heights with sexual fulfillment as &quot;the blessed few&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Why so few? According to a recent customer survey, one in five Americans is not interested in intercourse. According to recent estimates, more than one-third in the women in the usa have problems with low libido. Even this statistic may very well be low, as people may be embarrassed to respond to the interviewer genuinely. &quot;Diminished sexual desire&quot; within women, considered by some to become an epidemic, is a diagnosis &quot;du jour&quot; for some sex researchers together with therapists. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Loosing sexual desire may well undermine a person's conception of herself, her relationship to help her body and may cause an permanent strain in the woman's relationship. Chances are generally if her exhilaration for sex is actually diminished, her excitement for a lifetime in general is usually somehow compromised. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Exactly why are there just the &quot;blessed few&quot;? One in five is actually &quot;not interested&quot;???? Still another to a 50 % of American women doesn't have a desire for intercourse???? What's wrong with this particular picture? Why are so few people actually considering having sex, exploring it, heightening it? &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;There are lots of, many reasons that folks eschew sexual pleasure. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Primary, there are societal/cultural/religious has impact on. We live in a sex-negative culture. For instance, most Western societies don't support sexual education and learning and development. Parents are nevertheless battling to take away whatever beleaguered intercourse education courses are offered in the educational institutions (which, mind you, focus on procreation just), stating that teaching children about sex could be the purview on the town. Yet, in the homes, silence may be the order of your day and kids continue to be left to figure it out for themselves. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;As soon as children are left on their own devices, they're just subjected to misinformation from peers and their own fantasies about precisely what sex is. Once they become fixated with these levels, there's more on the chance that they'll grow up with certain erectile problems. (perversions, complications and compulsions) &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Traditional western culture has over time done much to help harm sexuality. Vestiges with the Victorian and Puritan eras, with their emphasis on exclusively procreative intercourse and discomfort with is a superb sexual pleasure, still resonate with many people, at least with an unconscious level. Sex is evil; sex is sin and eternal damnation. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;(which has been a big problem inside Christian community all through history, and still might resonate down from our personal parents' generation). &lt;br /&gt;;.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br&gt;;&lt;br&gt;;free mature porn: &lt;br&gt;;&lt;li&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG1hdHVyZXBvcm4uY29t" target="_blank"&gt;;free mature sex&lt;/a&gt;;, [url=]free mature porn[/url], [url=]free mature porn[/url]&lt;/li&gt;;		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
