&lt;br /&gt;;Heh! what kind of friendship?		</conversation>		<conversation id="6bcc1f7fa2f9a8062b85a0628888df5a">			Trouble arrives in measures,
&lt;br /&gt;;and we stack it up real high,
&lt;br /&gt;;until we're convinced,
&lt;br /&gt;;we have no reason to try.
&lt;br /&gt;;If you feel defeated,
&lt;br /&gt;;you're absolutely wrong,
&lt;br /&gt;;for if you follow your dream,
&lt;br /&gt;;you could never lose for long.
&lt;br /&gt;;Ignore the minor set-backs
&lt;br /&gt;;that pile up and trouble you,
&lt;br /&gt;;or you will build a mountain,
&lt;br /&gt;;out of the stones hurled at you.
&lt;br /&gt;;The future holds great promise,
&lt;br /&gt;;your destiny unknown,
&lt;br /&gt;;but God is always helping,
&lt;br /&gt;;and you're never alone.
&lt;br /&gt;;Soar bravely toward your goal.
&lt;br /&gt;;Let nothing darken the way.
&lt;br /&gt;;You can change your tomorrow,
&lt;br /&gt;;if you seek your dream today.		</conversation>		<conversation id="17b43b3a754e860848f79fc483a903e5">			Some people won't believe in you;
&lt;br /&gt;;they won't encourage you
&lt;br /&gt;;to follow your dreams,
&lt;br /&gt;;but you must always believe in you,
&lt;br /&gt;;no matter how long the journey
&lt;br /&gt;;ahead seems.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Some people will be jealous of you;
&lt;br /&gt;;their words will be sharp and unkind,
&lt;br /&gt;;but you must close your ears
&lt;br /&gt;;to such words,
&lt;br /&gt;;and never allow them to change
&lt;br /&gt;;your direction or your mind.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I'll always believe in you
&lt;br /&gt;;and encourage you
&lt;br /&gt;;to follow your dreams,
&lt;br /&gt;;and I'll try my best to show you
&lt;br /&gt;;that the road is never
&lt;br /&gt;;as long as it seems.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I'll always cheer for you;
&lt;br /&gt;;my words will be warm and kind,
&lt;br /&gt;;because I truly treasure you.
&lt;br /&gt;;You own a part of my heart,
&lt;br /&gt;;and you're always on my mind.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
