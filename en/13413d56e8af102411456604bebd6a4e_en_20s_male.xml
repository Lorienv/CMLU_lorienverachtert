&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;How I needed you
&lt;br /&gt;;How I grieve now you're gone
&lt;br /&gt;;In my dreams I see you
&lt;br /&gt;;I awake so alone
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I know you didn't want to leave
&lt;br /&gt;;Your heart yearned to stay
&lt;br /&gt;;But the strength I always loved in you
&lt;br /&gt;;Finally gave way
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Somehow I knew you would leave me this way
&lt;br /&gt;;Somehow I knew you could never stay
&lt;br /&gt;;And in the early morning light
&lt;br /&gt;;After a silent peaceful night
&lt;br /&gt;;You took my heart away
&lt;br /&gt;;And I grieve
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;In my dreams I can see you
&lt;br /&gt;;I can tell you how I feel
&lt;br /&gt;;In my dreams I can hold you
&lt;br /&gt;;And it feels so real
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I still feel the pain
&lt;br /&gt;;I still feel your love
&lt;br /&gt;;I still feel the pain
&lt;br /&gt;;I still feel your love
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Somehow I knew you could never, never stay
&lt;br /&gt;;And somehow I knew you would leave me
&lt;br /&gt;;And in the early morning light
&lt;br /&gt;;After a peaceful night
&lt;br /&gt;;You took my heart away
&lt;br /&gt;;I wished, I wished you could have stayed
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Sin duda uno de los mejores temas del mundo.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
