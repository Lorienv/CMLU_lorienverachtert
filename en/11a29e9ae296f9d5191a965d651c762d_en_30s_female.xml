Contact the author.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I picked up the ringing phone the opposite day. &quot;;Hello?&quot;; I said. Then I sat in shock as I heard on the opposite finish, &quot;;Hello, my name is Jim and i'm calling from XYZ Co.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;We are a full service communication provider and we tend to're offering clients a terribly special promotion on our satellite television services.
