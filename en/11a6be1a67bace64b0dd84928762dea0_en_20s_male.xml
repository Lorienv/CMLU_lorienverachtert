&lt;br /&gt;;Thinking it'll be alright. 
&lt;br /&gt;;You, you told me, 
&lt;br /&gt;;&quot;Come and take a look inside.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;;You believed me, 
&lt;br /&gt;;In every single lie. 
&lt;br /&gt;;But I, I failed you this time. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;And it feels like tonight. 
&lt;br /&gt;;I can't believe I'm broken inside. 
&lt;br /&gt;;Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do, 
&lt;br /&gt;;But try to make it up to you?

&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I never felt like this before. 
&lt;br /&gt;;Just when I leave, I'm back for more. 
&lt;br /&gt;;Nothing else here seems to matter. 
&lt;br /&gt;;In these ever-changing days, 
&lt;br /&gt;;You're the one thing that remains. 
&lt;br /&gt;;I could stay like this forever.
