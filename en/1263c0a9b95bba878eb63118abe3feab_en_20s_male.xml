Because you are not always what you do. I break damn rules just to be happy. Yeah, I'm happy doing crazy things. I'll do anything just to make myself happy. You can always see me smiling. I am fearfully and wonderfully made and there's only one ME in the world.

&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;MUSIC is my Girlfriend. because only music can let me reminisce back to my past. There are songs that can really make me cry. Music is the voice of what i feel inside, especially when i'm mute by the words of my mouth.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I don't take anything SERIOUSLY. I just go with the flow. i can be so mean when i want to be. Be Kind. I know my limits. I know my role. &lt;img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /&gt;; and and and i believe that life is summed up to three words..
