As autos have been flowing into yards in the CARS program, the competition for your kids is heating up. Auto dismantlers want the cars so that they can sell the used parts. Recyclers of scrap metal want them to crush into tiny sheet metal fragments, which can end up sold both locally together with internationally. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Furthermore steel, other metals including aluminum and copper can be salvaged and have quality value as scrap. It is actually cheaper and more efficient to recuperate metals from scrap than it is by mining and processing recycleables; and it is even more environmentally-friendly. Unbroken windows and windshields are removed intact and resold to car owners who need replacements and broken glass can be recycled. What is left on the vehicle after removing usable parts is place in a crusher which uses a mobile bailing press and flattener to crush your vehicle, and then is tell you a hammer mill which smashes the remains into fist-sized pieces which can then be sold since scrap.
