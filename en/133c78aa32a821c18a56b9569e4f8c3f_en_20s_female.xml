&lt;br /&gt;;We search and we hunt for our pleasure.
&lt;br /&gt;;Some adventures are fruitful, and some disappoint,
&lt;br /&gt;;But few find a gem they can treasure.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I’m so blessed I found you as my priceless prize;
&lt;br /&gt;;You’re a treasure in every way.
&lt;br /&gt;;I searched with the rest and discovered the best;
&lt;br /&gt;;Finding you was my luckiest day.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
