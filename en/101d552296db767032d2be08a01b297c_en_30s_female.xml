&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I thank GOD for the man I love
&lt;br /&gt;;Who shared his life to me
&lt;br /&gt;;Who on his own peculiar way
&lt;br /&gt;;Showed me his love on the day his with me.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I want to tell you through this verse
&lt;br /&gt;;That in my heart you served as FIRST
&lt;br /&gt;;That though I often do not show
&lt;br /&gt;;My love for you just grows and grows
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I love and miss you!		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
