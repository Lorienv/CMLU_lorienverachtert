[/b] &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;When someone you love is admitted to the hospital, the last thing over the mind of a caregiver or relative are concerns about them being discharged.

It is easy for all those involved with the patient's care, as well as that patient's family, to assume that once one is lying on a medical bed all decisions are made by somebody else.
