I looked at the Cooper mud terrains, BFG muddies, Good year and numerous other brands. The cooper tyres have a good reputation in America, and are very powerful but frankly have been way also costly for what I wanted. Certain, if you are travelling across Australia then it might be worth the added dough, but not for me. After some thought I decided to acquire a set of Maxxis Bighorns (33x12.five inches). These rubbed a little on the sidesteps and mud flaps, so I had to cut the sidesteps and eliminate the mud flaps at the front.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;They have a tendency not to be so wonderful on sand (since they like to dig holes) but if you deflate the tyres a fair bit beach operate becomes extremely straightforward. I have now accomplished about 15,000 kilometres on these Maxxis Bighorns, and they have carried out flawlessly. Compared to other muddies, they are extremely quiet on road. The wear has been nearly nonexistent (but make confident suitable rotation occurs). Taking into consideration they got rated second finest in the latest 4x4 tyre testing, they can't be as well negative! I will undoubtedly get yet another set, due to the fact they work brilliantly in mud and on rocks, and extremely nicely on the beach as well. They even rated greater than the Cooper muddies, which are about a hundred dollars much more for each and every tyre!&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;What I do not like about the HiluxThe Hilux does practically every little thing that I want it to, but there are a few locations that could be a bit better. The engine is only a two.four litre carbie, which means that power is not large. If you run it on petrol then its positive not slow, but possessing some further energy would be wonderful in the sand. I haven't re geared it because putting new tyres on, which implies beach operate is usually often low range. Several people convert these engines to normal commodore v6's, commodore v8's and even other Toyota v8s. As a dual cab Ute the room in the back is quite poor, but it is considerably greater than a five seater 2 door Ute. The only other point I could complain about is the suspension, but the only purpose it's not the best is because it is old and actually desires replacing. If I spent the money and got a set that was soft and flexible the ride would be much far better.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;What I enjoy about the Hilux&amp;bull???? ??Being so light it goes so much greater than a great deal of the heavier autos off-road (it only weighs 1600kg with the bar function and a driver)&amp;bull???? ??Small differential pumpkins imply brilliant clearance. Compared to Land cruisers and Patrols who have to run 35's to get very good clearance, I have wonderful clearance with tyres two inches smaller.&amp;bull???? ??Toyota reliability. For a truck that has accomplished 250,000 kilometres now and has in no way missed a beat, I can't complain.  Go for wider rather than taller wheel - tire diameters, the results is a greater make contact with patch and a sportier appear.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.luxurycustomwheels.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://www.luxurycustomwheels.com&lt;/a&gt;;, &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twcwheelstires.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://www.twcwheelstires.com&lt;/a&gt;;, &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestchromerims.com%2Fproducts%2FDefault.aspx%3Fkeyword%3Dblack%2520wheels"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://www.bestchromerims.com/products/Default.aspx?keyword=black%20wheels&lt;/a&gt;;		</conversation>		<conversation id="b250180b63449f792a21b0d7d3e6a06c">			Steel cbc11c009 wheels can suffer from hydrogen brittleness and can trigger cracks. I have a few mates with other car's that simply are not massive sufficient for me to drive comfortably.&amp;bull???? ??Vinyl floors and seats make it incredibly straightforward to clean.
