&lt;br /&gt;;Seems its already morning 
&lt;br /&gt;;I see the sky, its so beautiful and blue 
&lt;br /&gt;;The TV´s on 
&lt;br /&gt;;But the only thing showing is a picture of you 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Oh, I get up and make myself some coffee 
&lt;br /&gt;;I try to read a bit but the story´s too thin 
&lt;br /&gt;;Then I thank the Lord above 
&lt;br /&gt;;That you´re not there to see me 
&lt;br /&gt;;In this shape I´m in 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Spending my time 
&lt;br /&gt;;Watching the days go by 
&lt;br /&gt;;Feeling so small 
&lt;br /&gt;;I stare at the wall 
&lt;br /&gt;;Hoping that you think of me too 
&lt;br /&gt;;I´m spending my time 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I try to call but I don´t know what to tell you 
&lt;br /&gt;;I leave a kiss on your answering machine 
&lt;br /&gt;;Oh, help me please 
&lt;br /&gt;;Is there someone who can make me 
&lt;br /&gt;;Wake up from this dream? 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Spending my time 
&lt;br /&gt;;Watching the days good by 
&lt;br /&gt;;Feeling so small 
&lt;br /&gt;;I stare at the wall 
&lt;br /&gt;;Hoping that you are missing me too 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I´m spending my time 
&lt;br /&gt;;Watching the sun go down 
&lt;br /&gt;;I fall asleep to the sound 
&lt;br /&gt;;Of &quot;tears of a clown&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;;A prayer gone blind 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I´m spending my time 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;My friends keep telling me: 
&lt;br /&gt;;Hey, life will go on 
&lt;br /&gt;;Time will make sure will get over you 
&lt;br /&gt;;This silly game of love you play you win only to lose 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Spending my time 
&lt;br /&gt;;Watching the days good by 
&lt;br /&gt;;Feeling so small 
&lt;br /&gt;;I stare at the wall 
&lt;br /&gt;;Hoping that you are missing me too 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I´m spending my time 
&lt;br /&gt;;Watching the sun go down 
&lt;br /&gt;;I fall asleep to the sound 
&lt;br /&gt;;Of &quot;tears of a clown&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;;A prayer gone blind
