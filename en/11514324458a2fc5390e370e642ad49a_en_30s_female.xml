I would prefer someone who lives near me because I think that it would be hard 2 establish and sustain a long distance relationship.  I'm a grown woman and don't have the time or patience 4 games so if that is your agenda then do us both a favor and keep it moving.  I believe in taking my time and doing it right so if you want 2 hit and quit it once again do us both a favor and keep it moving.  I believe in love and want to experience the intoxication of being in love.  I recognize the difference between lust and love.  Lust is selfish, self-serving and is never satisfied while love is selfless and only satisfied when it is shared.  I am an affectionate and loving woman who loves to please her partner and who loves to be pleased in every way by her man.  I think it's important for a couple to spend time together but I also recognize the need to have your own outside interests as well.  I'm not needy or clingy and do not want a man who is.  I want to be with someone who likes being with me and who I like to spend time with.  I look forward to hearing from a real man who is secure in his manhood and wants a good woman to call his own.		</conversation>		<conversation id="43ec21a19814e8756cd10d55041447c2">			Attention All African Scammers!  You make yourself and your countrymen look bad with all your lies and deception.  It's down right pathetic and sickening the lengths that you will go to misrepresent yourselves.  Don't send me any friend invites because if you are not legit then I will cancel your asses like a bad check!  I don't have anything against people from Africa but I despise liars I don't care what part of the planet they live on!		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
