&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;You, do you remember me?
&lt;br /&gt;;Like I remember you?
&lt;br /&gt;;Do you spend your life
&lt;br /&gt;;Going back in your mind to that time?
&lt;br /&gt;;Because I, I walk the streets alone
&lt;br /&gt;;I hate being on my own
&lt;br /&gt;;And everyone can see that I really fell
&lt;br /&gt;;And I'm going through hell
&lt;br /&gt;;Thinking about you were somebody else
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Somebody wants you
&lt;br /&gt;;Somebody needs you
&lt;br /&gt;;Somebody dreams about you every single night
&lt;br /&gt;;Somebody can't breath without you, it's lonely
&lt;br /&gt;;Somebody hopes someday you will see
&lt;br /&gt;;That Somebody's Me 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;How, How could we go wrong
&lt;br /&gt;;It was so good and now it's gone
&lt;br /&gt;;And I pray at night that our paths soon will cross
&lt;br /&gt;;And what we had isn't lost
&lt;br /&gt;;Cause you're always right here in my thoughts

&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;You'll always be in my life
&lt;br /&gt;;Even if I'm not in your life
&lt;br /&gt;;Because you're in my memory
&lt;br /&gt;;You, will you remember me
&lt;br /&gt;;And before you set me free
