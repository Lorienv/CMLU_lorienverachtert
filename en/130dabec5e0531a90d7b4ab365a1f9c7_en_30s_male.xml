So let me begin with Hope today. Well we all need hope in and for our lives. No one can say that I do not need hope. When you are frastruted in life it is easy to say I have no need of hope. Keep your hope alive. As long as you are alive, live for the other day and take it one day at a time. You are the keeper of your hope and no one is. Whar can you do when all your hope is deplited? Fill it with good compay and right message of the Word of GOD.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
