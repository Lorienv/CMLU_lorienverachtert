&lt;br /&gt;;I do believe her,though i know she lies,
&lt;br /&gt;;Unlearn&amp;egrave&lt;img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /&gt;; in the worlds false subtleties.
&lt;br /&gt;;Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
&lt;br /&gt;;Although she knows my days are past the best,
&lt;br /&gt;;Simply i credited her false-speaking tongue:,
&lt;br /&gt;;On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.
&lt;br /&gt;;But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
&lt;br /&gt;;And wherefore say not i that iam old?.
&lt;br /&gt;;O,loves best habit is in seeming trust,
&lt;br /&gt;;And age in love,loves not to have years told.
&lt;br /&gt;;    Therefore i lie with her,and she with me,
&lt;br /&gt;;     and in our faults by lies we flattered be.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
