&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;This is an introduction to a Science of Spirit- Lost Keys to the kingdom of  Heaven on Earth by Robert Tonelli to learn more go to &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newscienceofspirit.ca"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;www.newscienceofspirit.ca&lt;/a&gt;; or email him at &lt;a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=scienceofspirit@live.ca"&gt;;scienceofspirit@live.ca&lt;/a&gt;;    
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;“Sometime early in the 21st century, the intelligence of machines will exceed that of humans. Within several decades, machines will exhibit the full range of human intellect, emotions and skills, ranging from musical and other creative aptitudes to physical movement. They will claim to have feelings and, unlike today's virtual personalities, will be very convincing when they tell us so. By 2019 a $1,000 computer will at least match the processing power of the human brain. By 2029 the software for intelligence will have been largely mastered, and the average personal computer will be equivalent to 1,000 human brains”. 
&lt;br /&gt;;“Once computers achieve a level of intelligence comparable to that of humans, they will necessarily soar past it. Quick downloading will allow our non-biological creations to share immediately what they learn with billions of other machines. Ultimately, non-biological entities will master not only the sum total of their own knowledge but all of ours as well.”  “As this happens, there will no longer be a clear distinction between human and machine. We are already putting computers… neural implants… directly into people's brains to counteract Parkinson's disease and tremors from multiple sclerosis.”  
&lt;br /&gt;;These are the philosophies, thoughts and forecasts made by Ray Kurzweil, the CEO of Kurzweil Technologies, Inc. This is the man who led teams which built the pioneering print-to-speech reading machines and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech-recognition systems. To gain insight into the kinds of forecasts Ray has made… we look to the documentation of his argument contained in his new book, The Age of Spiritual Machines… here he states it is important to recognize that technology is advancing exponentially... an exponential progression starts slowly, but eventually its pace increases extremely rapidly. Kurzweil say that the accelerating pace of technological progress means that our intelligent creations will soon eclipse us… and that their creations will eventually eclipse them. Ray’s forecast is based on the evolution of biological life and the evolution of technology which have both followed the same pattern in that they take a long time to get going… but advances build on one another and progress erupts at an increasingly furious pace. He states that we are entering the explosive part of the technological evolution curve right now.   
&lt;br /&gt;;In his book Ray explains why we see exponential progress occurring in biological life, technology and computing. He says it is the result of a fundamental attribute of any evolutionary process, a phenomenon he calls the Law of Accelerating Returns. “As order exponentially increases (which reflects the essence of evolution), the time between salient events grows shorter… Advancement speeds up…The returns… the valuable products of the process… accelerate at a nonlinear rate. The escalating growth in the price performance of computing is one important example of such accelerating returns.   An evolutionary process accelerates because it builds on past achievements, including improvements in its own means for further evolution… the resources it needs to continue exponential growth… are its own increasing order and the chaos in the environment in which the evolutionary process takes place, which provides the options for further diversity. These two resources are essentially without limit.”
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Figure 1. The accelerating rate of progress in computing is demonstrated by this graph, which shows the amount of computing speed that $1,000 (in constant dollars) would buy, plotted as a function of time. Computer power per unit cost is now doubling every.
&lt;br /&gt;;Ray Kurzweil states that the accelerating pace of technological progress means that our intelligent creations will soon eclipse us… and that their creations will eventually eclipse them. He explains the evolutionary process very well when it comes to creating conscious spiritual machines and their evolution.  
&lt;br /&gt;;This seems to me to be a real potential in the near future with science and technology…  backed by the engines of commerce in society…  a dream of  Cybernetic life for the product consuming Sheeple of a modern technological society… if we look at the current Hollywood movie themes [Terminator... Star Trek- the Borg]
&lt;br /&gt;;But what about us, “In Society” becoming conscious spiritual beings: Will we be “Left Behind”? in the dust of our own creations, unconscious of our own exponential growth in the Evolution of Consciousness, in favor of our creations which we put all our focus on and for what really? Is it so we can grease the “Engines of Commerce” in society, to increase our profit potential and spend all our time and energy creating bigger better corporations in a new Wal-Mart world? It seems we may be doing so… if we do not stand up and look around us long enough to let go of our wage slavery and “See” what is really happening in our world. We have the potential to greatly exceed our creations as creative spiritual beings enjoying a human experience making known the unknown in our lives… if we could only focus on our inner potentials and used our minds the way they were meant to be used “open”. This means to be conscious of our own actions… to take responsibility for our choices… to live productive lives… conscious of our next steps and become individually… remarkable creative spiritual human beings following and duplicating Nature’s-Gaia’s Magic. 
&lt;br /&gt;;For the most part… society’s Sheeple in general have been sitting on the sidelines and herded into the stands and coliseums as a limited few in the Human Race… pass the masses by on a remarkable journey into evolution. In this wonderful universe of ours Mother Nature only requires as much as 1% of us to be in the race for “The Evolution of Consciousness” to take place… while the rest of us sit back in our Lazy Boy Chairs… sipping on our six-pack of beer… watching the race go by on our big screen TVs… in our mortgaged Condos surrounded by all our material possessions… waiting to be recycled… hoping to get it right the next time around. Many of us at home… while we realize that it is the big game at the end of time and the end of evolution, not in the Race… are too committed to the illusion… to make any serious change… to be in harmony with “Gaia”. Serious change starts only with those who have taken the Red Pills… [ i.e. the Matrix] and can see through the illusions on or before Oct. 28, 2011… So Sheeple… not buying this… wanting to stay in the illusion… get your blue pills today… and you may be a star in the latest Matrix TV series… “ A Survivor Reality TV Show” an the end of time and global climactic change… can you Survive and be then next shooting Star… (warning the 2011-2012 fall seasons may…be cancelled due to global inclement weather, please stay tuned to your TV set… your umbilical cord to a virtual life in your pod).
&lt;br /&gt;;A New Mind:
&lt;br /&gt;;Years before Kurzweil made his forecasts, physicist and author Peter Russell predicted that conscious spiritual beings would make a great shift in the evolution of consciousness. Peter has stated, “Here, after billions of years, a creature has arisen that has transcended biological evolution. It is our minds, not our bodies which are evolving. We are a species that can explore and study its world; A species that looks for meaning and understanding: A species aware of its own consciousness; A most creative and ingenious species”. 
&lt;br /&gt;;It is this new mind that has arisen and is in less than 1% of the human beings on this planet at this time. This new mind that has transcended biological evolution and is a new level of consciousness called an &quot;Analogical State of Awareness&quot; and this is what this thesis is about. The foundation of my thesis is the “Evolution of Consciousness” studying a Science of Spirit… gaining wisdom… and finding the Lost Key to the Kingdom of Heaven. This philosophy is based on the correct understanding of the divine plan of the Real Mayan Calendar. This calendar does not time the events… dates and clock time of human society… but it is a calendar that times the evolution of consciousness from the beginning of the big Bang to the end result of the Quantum Singularity in time (as noted by Physicist Peter Russell) in and around Oct. 28, 2011. 
&lt;br /&gt;;This philosophy developed in me with some very deep realizations after a series of events that happened in 2004. I first met Ian Xel Lungold on Oct. 9, 2004 at a small lecture he gave in Calgary, Alberta. The lecture was on the true meaning of the Mayan calendar and the Evolution of the Consciousness, which it measures. I was fascinated by Ian’s novel approach and the significance of what he said about our intuition as our only hope in the future and that our mind was not our friend.
&lt;br /&gt;; To quote Ian from his lecture: “The Mayan Calendar is above all a prophetic calendar that may help us understand the past and foresee the future. The Mayan Calendar provides an exact schedule for the Cosmic Plan and the unfolding of all things that come into existence”.   
&lt;br /&gt;;This philosophy was a “synchronistic revelation” to the teachings of Ramtha on Analogical Awareness… to information that I had read from Peter Russell’s books “Global Brain” and the “White Hole in Time” about 10 years before… but I had not put all the pieces together… until it was put into the context of the Mayan Calendar and the timing of the evolution of consciousness. The synchronicity of events really began to affect me a few days after my encounter with Ian Xel Lungold and my contemplation on the evolution of consciousness… when a friend of mind asked me to go with him to see the movie… “The Passion of Christ” an intense movie of Christ’s final days of the crucifixion. Several days later, we saw the movie, “The Corporation”… another intense movie of the detailed accounts of the abuses of international corporations and the impact they are having on our global society today. I immediately felt that that the latter movie should have been named, “The Corporation:  The Passion of the Antichrist”. If you have not seen this movie, rent it, because what is going on in the realm of the Multi-National Corporations is staggering. I think if J.R. Tolkien would have written the Lord of the Rings today… he would have modeled Lord Sarron, The Dark Lord, “The Lord of the Rings” after the modern day “GREY MEN”, “the powers that be”… that control the Multi-National Corporation CEO’s (one Ring – One Corporation to rule them all… in a Dark New World Order…) 
&lt;br /&gt;;The comparisons between Christ Consciousness and the Corporate Social Consciousness gave me revelations of biblical proportions especially when I contemplated the significance of the Evolution of a holistic Christ Consciousness verses the evolution of the splintering “Psychopathic” consciousness of an Anti-Christ-like Multi-National Corporation in a free market capitalistic society.[ Corporations in America are people under the law with all the rights and privileges of a natural born citizen but with the power and money of a dozen corporate lawyers to defend their rights to pollute the country.]  Corporate CEO's are running the greatest Ponzie schemes in the history of the money changers since Christ's time… The Bernie Madoffs' of the world have literally… “Made off with Your Money and  “Bush-Whacked&quot; the American Dream” [ see chapter 5] .  This corporate idealism is beautifully illustrated in the Movie… Capitalism… A Love Story by Michael Moore.  
&lt;br /&gt;;This is one of the reasons why I started to compile related research articles on this topic… was to provide Ian Lungold with more ammunition, in his talks, in the fight against the total lack of knowledge of the evolution of consciousness… and the static Matrix illusion in society. This book came together out of a response to help other people so I began to write down some thoughts so that I could speak about what I knew. It was only when I met Ian Lungold that I got a real sense of the importance of the Mayan Calendar… what Ian had said… what I had learned about an &quot;Analogical State of Awareness&quot;  and how complete and important the information was… now All I wanted to do was put some research together that I had studied in Washington State that confirmed Ian’s truth and give it to him. After I made that decision in the fall of 2004 and began the process… a doorway seemed to open for me. Each day something would come to me and I would write it down.  
&lt;br /&gt;;This book… &quot;Science of Spirit&quot;, is my Analogical understanding of an Evolution of Consciousness and is dedicated to the passion and genius of Ian Lungold and takes up where he left off… exposing the truth behind the counterfeit Mayan Calendar and it predictions of the end of the world at the end of it 5125 year countdown and the biblical Armageddon in the year 2012… We will see how differing Political factions and religious groups mixed with a little dung of Disaster Capitalism can stir the pot of human ignorance and produce fears of terrorism and accusations of a Great Global Warming Swindle…		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
