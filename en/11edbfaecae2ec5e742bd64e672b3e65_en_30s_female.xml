Since his inception, the fictional, super hero character Spider Man has featured in three films.  The three  Spider Man movies, Spider Man  (2002), Spider Man 2 (2004) and Spider Man 3 (2007); all of them starring Peter (Tobey Maguire) as Spider man, a young high school student who has just discovered his spider like abilities. The storyline of the three movies continues to describe Peter’s bond with his high school crush, Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and his battles with various villains in the setting. These movies got incredible attention worldwide, earning themselves approval even from hard to win movie critics.
