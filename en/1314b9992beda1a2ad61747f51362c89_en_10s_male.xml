Not only was it back-breaking work to use a garden rake to pile up the leaves, but it took a long time. Today, we are fortunate with countless brands of leaf blowers, at prices to fit every budget.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The leaf blower is not a complex nor mystical machine. All it has to perform happens to be blow leaves. Essentially, it's just a tube connected with a high speed fan that's enclosed in a cover. The tubing focuses the blowing wind from the fan precisely where you want it, shifting the leaves in that direction. Leaf blowers prove useful specifically when you have a lot of trees that drop loads of leaves, like oak trees, or a large garden that needs cleaning. A leaf blower could help you save a lot of time and eliminate a lot of wear and tear on the back.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Leaf blowers come in many sizes and strengths, from expert models created to be carried in a back harness all the way to light-weight units you can carry and use with one arm. You may need the back harness type if you suffer neck or back problems. Also, you can get yourself a leaf blower that is hand held and can collect the leaves, or one that just blows them where you want them. A few garden leaf blowers tend to be more than just something to blow leaves around. They even collect hedge clippings, clean out tin cans, grass clippings and rubbish. If you are not sure which type of leaf blower is for you, just consider what all you'll want it to be able to do.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Your garden labor can be completed easily and fun by using the effective and powerful, Toro Ultra 3-in-1 Blower, Vacuum, and Leaf Shredder. Being electrical, it's cleaner, lighter and more quiet than comparable gas-fueled blowers, and still boasts 235 mph air speeds. It operates at various speeds, and has a metal impeller that shreds most debris into tiny pieces. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Leaves become mere mulch, allowing you to pack what used to be 16 bags of leaves into a single bag. You may use this useful machine in 3 basic ways - like a regular blower, a mulcher or as a vacuum cleaner, all with no need for tools. The impeller, with erose metal cutters, can certainly mulch unwanted debris and leaves. The resulting mulch can be spread throughout your yard and/or garden, saving you money on grass and plant nutrients.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The Toro Ultra 3-in-1 is much more quiet when compared with any gas leaf blower, is more eco-friendly, and, becasue it is electric, requires far less maintenance and cleaning. It gets going with the push of a button - no twisted pull cords to cope with. You don't need to be around noxious fumes, or be concerned about a messy gas-oil mixture. One problem appears to be needing an electrical cord and plugin.		</conversation>		<conversation id="d4669d5abb894aa1574a08fbbb13ed21">			Among 33 inexpensive smaller cars, the 2012 Ford Focus rates 4th, determined by 24 recent reviews and test drives. Because it's been completely redesigned for 2012, reviewers and test drivers absolutely love the updated Focus. This is thanks not only to the fantastic improvements to both the exterior and interior, but it is simply more fun to drive.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The moment it first was released back in 2000, the Ford Focus was hugely popular, but its charm diminished a bit over ensuing years as its competitors made improvements to their cars. It's now eleven years down the track, and with a car that's been redesigned totally, Ford hopes the Focus will become one of the top choices in affordable small cars again. These people realize the competition is serious, what with the Chevy Cruze, the Honda Fit and the Mazda 3, but they're more than ready to take them on. Ford's hopes can be partly based on all the high tech improvements to the interior of the Focus. Most of these modifications are the keyless entry and ignition, a semi-automatic parallel parking system, and a rearview camera.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;In addition, around the steering wheel you'll find an all new configuration of 5-way touch pads, which creates a whole new driver technology. An 8-inch touch screen comes with the high-end versions. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;A couple of options, MyKey and MyFord, that are offered on other models such as the Ford Edge, now come on the Focus. Navigation, entertainment, and communication are built-in by MyFord into a touch screen control unit. When your adolescent is operating the car, MyKey will control the speed of the vehicle and the volume of the stereo as a safety feature. Yet another first for this car type is its torque vectoring command feature. This adds braking pressure to the wheels, thereby maximizing stability, which is going to be loved by all car enthusiasts.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The cutting edge overall look of the Focus' exterior has received kudos from the industry. It's sportier than the previous models and also more aggressive, to be more like the Honda Fit and Ford Fiesta. However, how about once the excitement fades and the reviews are history - will the Focus survive? No one's certain what may come to pass with the Focus, there being so many competitors in the small car market. As an illustration, there happen to be three cars that are just as good as the Focus in value for money, and possibly available features and utility - they are the Honda Fit, the Chevy Cruze and the Hyundai Elantra.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Make sure and at least check out these three competitors if you're thinking about purchasing a Focus. Nonetheless, the focus is the ideal car for a lot of of us, what with its 2012 redesign and new features. It might not be as large as you need, but it's certainly cheap.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
