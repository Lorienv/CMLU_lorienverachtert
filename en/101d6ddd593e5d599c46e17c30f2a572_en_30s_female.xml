&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Why is it that men have such power ?they have such power because us as women give it to them,the power of a man wouldn't mean anything without a woman 
&lt;br /&gt;;if things aren't right between you and your man and you realise that he treats you bad.jus remember that he can only do wat you allow.
&lt;br /&gt;;Never underestimate your power because with it you achieve much but without it you are stuck with the power of a man.
&lt;br /&gt;;A man has the power to love a woman in the way that she's never been loved,yet hurt her in the same way
&lt;br /&gt;;A man has the power to make a woman  cry from happiness and joy suddenly turns his bek to make cry from hurt and anger
&lt;br /&gt;;Aman has the power to let a woman feel wanted and free,but also feel disgusted and unworthy
&lt;br /&gt;;A man has the power to look a woman in her eyes and tell her he adores her,but turn around and have s*x with her best friend		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
