Jobs&amp;nbsp;had surgery for pancreatic cancer nine months after he was diagnosed, as soon as the complementary medicine approach he had taken still did not work.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;strong&gt;;Jobs' Health Is really a Sign of a larger Problem&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Jobs is a strong believer in complementary medicine anf the husband likely truly believes the therapy he or she is receiving will take away the health problem, whatever it is. Though the point is, like the undeniable fact that the &quot;hormonal imbalance&quot; can be a symptom of a bigger problem, this focus on&amp;nbsp;Jobs' health is really a characteristic of a board of directors not doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The matter isn't whether&amp;nbsp;Jobs' health ought to be an individual matter; the issue is how irreplaceable&amp;nbsp;Jobs is always to Apple. People die, often suddenly, and a many people think that Apple's success, possibly even its life, is associated with Jobs'. It continues to be the duty from the Apple board of directors in order to guarantee the continuance of Apple, however the board seems more set on hiding any risk that might force Apple's CEO to go away.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;strong&gt;;Board Fiduciary Responsibility and Insider Trading Risk&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Each board acts to actively mask or conceal information that is certainly material towards the survival of the company, particularly information that can not be contained in the catering company, such as the condition of an CEO (doctors, nurses, family members all have aspects of these details), you've got a severe problem associated with insider trading that boosts the risks being taken by Apple and it is board.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;It certainly can be understood that, after once being fired, Jobs really wants to keep his CEO job so long as possible, and yes it isn't uncommon for any board to aid a good CEO with substantially a smaller hold than Jobs dons Apple on this goal. But it also often showcases an upside-down relationship from the company's board and it is CEO. The CEO should report to the board, not vice versa. Once this kind of problem happens, whether it be Enron or Apple, bad decisions often result.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;strong&gt;;The Unheeded Warning&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The warning was the stock option post-dating problem that almost every CEO aside from Jobs lost their position, and often freedom, over. This latest is actually another reminder that Apple craves an alternative for Jobs, not just in run the company, but to become a person's face of it. That individual might be trained, much like&amp;nbsp;Jobs himself was trained, to get that face, but it will require (depending on initial skill set) between&amp;nbsp;six months and&amp;nbsp;3 years to get it done.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Until this is achieved,&amp;nbsp;Jobs' health isn't private because Apple is really a public company, and his awesome health is way too critical (valued by some at approximately $20 billion) on the company's survival. There is no more essential project for Jobs or Apple's board than fixing this issue.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;blockquote&gt;;&lt;i&gt;;&lt;b&gt;;&quot;Your time is restricted, so never allow it's wasted living another woman's life.&quot; -Steve Jobs, CEO Apple Computer, CEO Pixar&lt;/b&gt;;&lt;/i&gt;;&lt;/blockquote&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;For Health-related reasons, finding a degree meant living somebody else's life; so he dropped out. It's confidence which is so strong who's makes it simplallows you to check out your heart and intuition, as Jobs advised.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYXB0b3AtcmVwYWlyLW1hbmNoZXN0ZXIuY28udWsvaXBob25lLXJlcGFpcnMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank"&gt;;iphone repairs manchester&lt;/a&gt;;		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
