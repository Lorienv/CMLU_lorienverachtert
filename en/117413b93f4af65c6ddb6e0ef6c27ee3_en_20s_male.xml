After about 7 years of paying by the hour and being dissatisfied with their performance, I made a decision to switch to paying on a percentage basis. I discovered that the quality of labor went up dramatically and the tasks have been completed in half the time.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The painters had an improved mindset when being paid on a proportion basis.
