They are also scoped differently, from compiler to runtime, depending on the purpose. In principle it is about providing additional information about a TYPE, PARAMETER, FIELD or METHOD. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;You find typical uses in the JPA specs, the various dependency injection frameworks, JAX-WS/JAX-RS specs and many others
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The annotations definitely reduce number of lines of code but there are few drawbacks: 
&lt;br /&gt;;1. Code will very difficult to understand later. 
&lt;br /&gt;;2. Debugging code becomes difficult. 
&lt;br /&gt;;3.Annotations are harder to use with third-party libraries- this violates POJO programming.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
