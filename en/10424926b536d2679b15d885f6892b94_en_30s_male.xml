If you wish to create excellent songs, you will need to own the hottest sound producing tools or ideally a complete professional studio along with the necessary equipment to get the maximum out of each and every beat. Having said that, it's obvious that not everyone is able to afford such items, so what exactly should most people do then?&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;One of the well-liked solutions that young beat makers prefer is by running a beat making program. These beat making applications can be downloaded from the internet and installed on your PC or Mac in only a few minutes. Occasionally you don't even have to install anything! Some of them are over priced (not as expensive as a studio not surprisingly) but commonly speaking you can get extremely decent ones for below $40.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The issue is that most these beat maker software programs are terribly bad quality and if you try and make your own music with them, you'll be surprised how awful the music is and it just doesn't sound suitable. This is when things begin to get tough, because if you'd like to make rap beats, but do not have the tools, then its game over?&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Sick beats may be made using the aid of laptop or computer applications, and I've proof of that. A couple of months ago I was in the same position as you're now: trying to find a decent software that will help me create some really cool rap beats.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;This program is named Dub Turbo, and I suspect it's the last kit to make your own rap beats. I can not believe you can get a fully functional octave keyboard with it, and drum machine, track sequencer, pre-made music beats and much more. Essentially it's a complete high-def audio workstation, installed on your notebook. Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;What is better yet is that you could check it out for sixty days following the purchase, and if you continue to do dislike it, you can get your money back, as it includes one hundred percent moneyback guarantee. It may be an everyone wins scenario, and I really endorse Dub Turbo to anyone curious about making music on-line, simply because it's just remarkable!&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;If you're ready to start your music career right now with DUBturbo and have your first track ready in only ten minutes from now, check out my personal  &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeyourownbeatwww.1.net%2Fdubturbo-review%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://www.makeyourownbeatwww.1.net/dubturbo-review/&lt;/a&gt;; !		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
