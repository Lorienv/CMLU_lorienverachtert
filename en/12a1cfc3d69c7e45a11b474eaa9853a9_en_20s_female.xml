But I'm always on Myspace. So if you want to check out some things about me just go to &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myspace.com%2Fashley_2455"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;www.myspace.com/ashley_2455&lt;/a&gt;; and you can find tons of things about me or whatever. 
&lt;br /&gt;;so if you do check that out make sure you add me.
