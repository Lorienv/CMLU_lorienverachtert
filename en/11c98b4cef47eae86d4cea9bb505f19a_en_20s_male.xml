Love is not just saying I LOVE U or havin SEX &amp; KISSING.. Instead,LOVE is GIVING &amp; CARING unconditionally,PATIENCE with pain,LONGSUFFERING with pain,SACRIFICING with pain,love unconditionally with pain. Love em with your BODY,SOUL &amp; SPIRIT. I'd give the whole world to anyone just to love my big B &amp; small B.		</conversation>		<conversation id="fb65866ebb7b9fe93989ca8d67c7729c">			This country is full of corrupt leaders and is heading backwards eventhough its a very rich country...what a shame!!		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
