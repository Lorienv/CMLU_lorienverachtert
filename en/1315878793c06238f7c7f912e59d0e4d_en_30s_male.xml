We need to build our communities by providing services that promote accountability, dignity, and restoration for released inmates.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Martinez Association Inc is a nonprofit organization formed to help struggling released felons. Some of the services we offer are: resume writing, job search assistance, clothing assistance, and more. We also help our clients recognize their strengths, weaknesses, needs, interests, and skills. Providing these types of services will reduce recidivism and enhance the safety of society, while allowing our clients to build rewarding, productive lives.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Our Society should not waste tax money keeping convicted felons in prison. Instead, we must focus on helping them contribute in a positive way to our community. Putting more law enforcement officers in the community is not the long-term solution. Instead, we need more programs to start opening more doors for convicted felons
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Each ex-felon in our community who finds a livelihood and a reason to stay clean reduces  crime and becomes a productive citizen who contributes to the well-being of us all.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
