&lt;br /&gt;;It can buy a clock _ but not time 
&lt;br /&gt;;It can buy you a book _ but not knowledge 
&lt;br /&gt;;It can buy you a position _ but not respect 
&lt;br /&gt;;It can buy you medicine _ but not health 
&lt;br /&gt;;It can buy you blood _ but not life 
&lt;br /&gt;; Finally it can buy you sex _ but not love
&lt;br /&gt;;       So you see money isn't everything, and it often causes pain and suffering. I tell you all this because I am your friend and as your friend I want to take your pain and suffering.  So send me all your money and I suffer for you		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
