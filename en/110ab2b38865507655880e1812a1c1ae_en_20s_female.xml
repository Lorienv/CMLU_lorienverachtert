However, many become discouraged when they don't see results as soon as they had expected. Why can some people maintain their weight after losing it? One wonders if there is a secret to this amazing accomplishment. What might this secret be?&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The first thing you need to do when thinking about weight loss is figure out what your goals are. Can you visualize a certain number that you would like to see on the scale? What about clothes? Would you like to go down a size or two, or maybe fit into your current wardrobe better? Are you in need of a better figure and a bit more energy?&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Actually putting your goals in writing can really help you stay motivated to adhere to your plan. Develop a log where you write down every piece of food you eat. Review your journal entries before you go to sleep to make sure you are staying on track with your caloric goals. Keep your weekly weight losses or gains in this journal, as well. The use of a graph is a great visual motivator in your weight loss journal.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Don't let yourself become extremely hungry. This will lead to very poor choices in foods. Planning your meals in advance and keeping healthy snacks on hand will help you avoid reaching for unhealthy foods. Instead of eating out, you should bring your own lunch. It is cheaper, and you have control over the calorie content of the meal.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;If losing weight is really important to you, then you need to focus on both diet and activity. Plan a workout routine that is certain to keep your motivation level high by selecting a particular activity you love. When you are trying to find something fun to do to keep exercising fun think about a dance class or a sport that you like. You can always even work out with friends. Make sure you are creative with your exercise endeavors.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;To rid yourself of temptations clean out your pantry of all junk food. If you only buy foods that are good for you there will be less temptation at home. If you do not keep unhealthy foods in your home, you will be less likely to consume snacks that make you put on unwanted pounds.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;It will be up to you to lose the weight, but it will be much easier if you have a good support system or someone to go through your weight-loss journey with you. Even when you are at the end of your rope, your friends can cheer you on and help you stay on track. The ones around you can help you stay on track.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Resources&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbHVtYnVzb3VuZC5jb20vMjAxMi8wNC8wNS9lYXRpbmctd2VsbC1hbmQtZXhlcmNpc2luZy1hcmUta2V5LXRvLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank"&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcolumbusound.com%2F2012%2F04%2F05%2Feating-well-and-exercising-are-key-to-health%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://columbusound.com/2012/04/05/eating-well-and-exercising-are-key-to-health/&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2RvbWluYmVuaXRvLmNvbS8yMDEyLzA0LzA1L2tlZXBpbmctZml0LWRvZXMtbm90LWhhdmUtdG8tYmUtYm9yaW5nLw__" target="_blank"&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdominbenito.com%2F2012%2F04%2F05%2Fkeeping-fit-does-not-have-to-be-boring%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://dominbenito.com/2012/04/05/keeping-fit-does-not-have-to-be-boring/&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BwaWR1bmlhLm9yZy8yMDEyLzA0LzA1L2tlZXBpbmctZml0LXRoZS1rZXktdG8tbG9uZy1oZWFsdGgv" target="_blank"&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fppidunia.org%2F2012%2F04%2F05%2Fkeeping-fit-the-key-to-long-health%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://ppidunia.org/2012/04/05/keeping-fit-the-key-to-long-health/&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NvZG1nLmNvbS9tZW1iZXIvYWJyYWhhbWthbmU3MTYvYmxvZy8zMDE0NC9LZWVwLXNtaWxpbmctd2l0aC1leGVyY2lzZQ__" target="_blank"&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fsodmg.com%2Fmember%2Fabrahamkane716%2Fblog%2F30144%2FKeep-smiling-with-exercise"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://sodmg.com/member/abrahamkane716/blog/30144/Keep-smiling-with-exercise&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3JhZGlvanV2ZW50dXNkb25ib3Njby5jb20vMjAxMi8wNC8wNS9lYXRpbmctd2VsbC1hbmQtZXhlcmNpc2luZy1hcmUta2V5LXRvLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank"&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fradiojuventusdonbosco.com%2F2012%2F04%2F05%2Feating-well-and-exercising-are-key-to-health%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://radiojuventusdonbosco.com/2012/04/05/eating-well-and-exercising-are-key-to-health/&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/a&gt;;		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
