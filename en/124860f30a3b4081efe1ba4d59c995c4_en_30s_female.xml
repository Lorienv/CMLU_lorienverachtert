The initial solitary from the album, Radio Nowehere, is really a extremely touching composition with deep lyrics.

Magic, the title monitor in the album, can boast of a wonderful arrangement and meditative melody, creating magical environment thank you to the rythmical tinkling from the tambourine. The final monitor on Magic, Devil's Arcade, is the only 1 that offers with politics. It has a extremely strong lyrics and effective pictures that are positive to depart no one serene.
