That is, your doctor will probably encourage you to first try dieting and exercise to reduce your weight. However, medications can help people who need to lose quite a bit of weight for health reasons. The following article will help you make the right choice in regard to whether or not you should take prescription medications to lose weight. Weight reduction is just like  &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fatburningfurnacej.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://www.fatburningfurnacej.org&lt;/a&gt;; , the much more you take action on it, the greater it is.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Physicians will sometimes prescribe very potent medications like Diethylpropion to help people lose weight if necessary. It's an appetite suppressant, so if you take it while also exercising, you may be able to lose some weight quickly with its help. On the other hand, you shouldn't think of it as a long term solution, as it can be habit forming and doctors only recommend it for short term use. This particular drug is certainly beneficial, especially if you know what dosage to take and if you should use the extended release formula or not. You will generally consume several of the pills per day. So if you're taking this medication, although it may work, never exceed the recommended daily amount prescribed by your doctor or you may have adverse side effects.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Very effective, Phendimetrazine, or Bontril is another prescription medication that you can get to suppress your appetite and lose weight. On an empty stomach, you need to take this medication about an hour before you eat so it can help you reduce your appetite when you consume food. Using appetite suppressants like Bontril can definitely help you shed bodyweight, and should always be used with the proper diet and exercise program. The worst thing about these particular weight loss products is that they can become habit-forming. You may experience side effects after taking this drug. Once you stop taking Bontril, it is possible that you will gain all the way back but you lost which would be very unfavorable. Utilizing a weight-loss drug is just like  &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fatburningfurnacej.org%2Fshould-you-buy-fat-burning-furnace"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://www.fatburningfurnacej.org/should-you-buy-fat-burning-furnace&lt;/a&gt;; , you should be cautious.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The consideration you need to make is whether or not a drug for weight loss, once you stop taking it, will stop preventing you from losing weight again. Your doctor will more than likely give you a prescription that you can use for only a short duration. This means that you have to be prepared with a plan to keep any weight you've lost from returning once you're not taking the drug anymore. This is why most doctors will recommend taking up some type of exercise program and eating better than ever before. Simply stated, you will have to get by without the medication at some point so start learning how to do this as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Although this article has presented several interesting perspectives in regard to medical weight-loss pills, the final verdict should always be that of your physician. The bottom line is that regular exercise, combined with eating properly and taking your weight loss meds on time, will be your most direct route to a body with less excess fat. Becoming overweight is actually a issue just like  &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fatburningfurnacej.org%2Ffat-burning-furnace-ultimate-fitness-system-what-you-need-to-know"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://www.fatburningfurnacej.org/fat-burning-furnace-ultimate-fitness-system-what-you-need-to-know&lt;/a&gt;;  is, so act on it just before it is too late.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Related Resources:&lt;br /&gt;; &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3D4c87b814257d43789ac30acbf73a212a%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3D4c87b814257d43789ac30acbf73a212a%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253a4c87b814257d43789ac30acbf73a212aPost%253a979e2597-ebb8-46e3-8ca3-3c3f1774cc36%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=4c87b814257d43789ac30acbf73a212a&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=4c87b814257d43789ac30acbf73a212a&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a4c87b814257d43789ac30acbf73a212aPost%3a979e2597-ebb8-46e3-8ca3-3c3f1774cc36&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5&lt;/a&gt;;  &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fquizilla.teennick.com%2Fstories%2F21854847%2Fhow-prescription-drugs-for-weight-loss-stack-up-to-other-alternatives"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://quizilla.teennick.com/stories/21854847/how-prescription-drugs-for-weight-loss-stack-up-to-other-alternatives&lt;/a&gt;;		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
