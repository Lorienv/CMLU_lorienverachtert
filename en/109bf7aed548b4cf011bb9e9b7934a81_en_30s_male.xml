&lt;br /&gt;I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope
&lt;br /&gt;for a destination
&lt;br /&gt;I realized quickly when I knew I should
&lt;br /&gt;that the world was made up of this brotherhood of 
&lt;br /&gt;man
&lt;br /&gt;for whatever that mean
&lt;br /&gt;'n so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
&lt;br /&gt;just to get it all out what's in my head
&lt;br /&gt;'n I, I'm feeling a little peculiar
&lt;br /&gt;'n so I wake in the morning and I step outside
&lt;br /&gt;'n I take a deep breath		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
