&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;CHEER UP IF YOU HAVE LOST OR WON.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;ITS JUST YOUR PRIDE WHICH MAKES YOU FEEL
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;YOU MUST BE ALWAYS NUMBER ONE.		</conversation>		<conversation id="93eb5eed479cb836379e01e650ee119a">			IF I COULD ASK ONE GIFT FROM GOD
&lt;br /&gt;;ONE GIFT AND NOTHING MORE
&lt;br /&gt;;I&quot;D CHOOSE THE PRICELESS GIFT OF LOVE
&lt;br /&gt;;TO TREASURE IN MY STORE.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;THEN I WOULD OWN THE PRECIOUS BALM
&lt;br /&gt;;TO CURE THE WORLD OF HATE
&lt;br /&gt;;I&quot;D MAKE MY LITTLE WORLD A PLACE
&lt;br /&gt;;WHERE RICH AND POOR RELATE.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;FOR LOVE CAN RECONCILE BAD FOES
&lt;br /&gt;; AND MAKE US ONE AGAIN.
&lt;br /&gt;;SO OPEN WIDE YOUR WOUNDED HEART
&lt;br /&gt;;AND LET LOVE HEAL THE PAIN.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
