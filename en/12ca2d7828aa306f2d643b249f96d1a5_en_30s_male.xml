&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;There is certainly scores of businesses specialising in moves to Spain and you hear of many tragedy tales where the mover has failed to turn up on time, detained individuals property in store for several weeks prior to sending, damaged effects and worst of all failing to deliver full stop.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;These pitfalls can effortlessly be avoided by deciding on a member of The British Association Of Removers ( BAR ) who are audited on a repeated basis to make sure all techniques and workers work to the high values compulsory for membership.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Further more members of BAR work under terms and conditions that have been approved by The Office Of Fair Trading and an impartial arbitration service is offered to all customers using a BAR member if things go amiss.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;If you are obtaining a part load service ask the hauler how long it will take for your effects to arrive at Spain, as certain delivery companies ask for up to thirty  days from time of collection on a part load service.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;If you do not want your effects on the same vehicle as other clients or you are not able to afford to wait for a part load service, ask the relocation company for a dedicated vehicle estimate.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;When it comes to packing your effects most removal providers offer  numerous degrees of packing services as follows;
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Fragiles packing- As the name suggests the transporter will pack all fragile effects including crockery, mirrors, glass, chandeliers and pictures. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Full Packing- This is in general as the fragiles pack but the mover will then proceed to pack games, clothes, video's/DVD's CD's, toys, books
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Export Packing- This is normally every full packing service but  furniture will be individually wrapped in protective material.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Our suggestion is to at least make use of the relocation companies fragile packing service as it simplifies things with insurers in the improbable occurrence of damages. Basically if the removals company packs your fragiles they will be deemed by the insurers to have been competently packed using the appropriate techniques and equipment.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The majority removal companies will be charging you on a charge per cubic foot or cubic metre. If you propose on a home estimation a good quality surveyor will be able to break down the rate of shipping per item to give you a idea on what is and isn't worth moving.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Declutter, there's no sense spending to have things taken to Spain merely to toss them away once you get there. Additionally way up the rate of transportation as opposed to buying new in Spain.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Not all fixtures is less expensive in Spain and it's not always probable to acquire fixtures in Spain that meets your taste so this will take a bit of exploration.
