&lt;br /&gt;;I guess that's why sometimes
&lt;br /&gt;;I get impatient waiting,
&lt;br /&gt;;Wondering when we'll finally be together
&lt;br /&gt;;All the time.
&lt;br /&gt;;I understand that it has to be this way for now, 
&lt;br /&gt;;And I really believe we're doing 
&lt;br /&gt;;The right thing.
&lt;br /&gt;;I trust that our love is strong enough
&lt;br /&gt;;To see us through,
&lt;br /&gt;;and that someday soon
&lt;br /&gt;;we'll be able to talk and touch
&lt;br /&gt;;and love each other
&lt;br /&gt;;the way we've wanted to for so long.
&lt;br /&gt;;I'ts just difficult for me sometimes
&lt;br /&gt;;because I want you so much now. ;-/		</conversation>		<conversation id="87afb59ddd4f4073201e65a1efc06e6b">			People come into your life for a reason, a season or a lifetime. When you 
&lt;br /&gt;;know which one it is, you will know what to do for that person. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need 
&lt;br /&gt;;you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to 
&lt;br /&gt;;provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally 
&lt;br /&gt;;or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend and they are. They are there 
&lt;br /&gt;;for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing on your 
&lt;br /&gt;;part or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to 
&lt;br /&gt;;end the relationship. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk 
&lt;br /&gt;;away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. What we must 
&lt;br /&gt;;realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is 
&lt;br /&gt;;done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and now it is time to move 
&lt;br /&gt;;on. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Some people come into your life for a SEASON, because your turn has come to 
&lt;br /&gt;;share, grow or learn. They bring you an experience of peace or make you 
&lt;br /&gt;;laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give 
&lt;br /&gt;;you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it, it is real But only for a 
&lt;br /&gt;;season. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons, things you must build 
&lt;br /&gt;;upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept 
&lt;br /&gt;;the lesson, love the person and put what you have learned to use in all 
&lt;br /&gt;;other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind 
&lt;br /&gt;;but friendship is clairvoyant. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Thank you for being a part of my life , 
&lt;br /&gt;;whether you were a reason, a season or a lifetime.		</conversation>		<conversation id="26bbf59e943d2a8fcf7d8d3c36dfad56">			Too often we don't realize
&lt;br /&gt;;what we have until it is gone;
&lt;br /&gt;;Too often we wait too late to say
&lt;br /&gt;;&quot;I'm sorry - I was wrong.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;;Sometimes it seems
&lt;br /&gt;;we hurt the ones
&lt;br /&gt;;we hold dearest
&lt;br /&gt;;to our hearts;
&lt;br /&gt;;And we allow foolish things to tear our lives apart.
&lt;br /&gt;;Far too many times
&lt;br /&gt;;we let unimportant things into our minds;
&lt;br /&gt;;And then it's usually too late
&lt;br /&gt;;to see what made us blind.
&lt;br /&gt;;So be sure that you let people know how much
&lt;br /&gt;;they mean to you;
&lt;br /&gt;;Take that time to say the words
&lt;br /&gt;;before your time is through.
&lt;br /&gt;;Be sure that you appreciate
&lt;br /&gt;;everything you've got'
&lt;br /&gt;;And be thankful for the Little Things in Life
&lt;br /&gt;;that mean a lot.		</conversation>		<conversation id="46fa27b31375c5870a843216c15365f">			The wind's not always at our back; the sky's not always blue.
&lt;br /&gt;;Sometimes we crave the things we lack and don't know what to do.
&lt;br /&gt;;Sometimes life's an uphill ride with mountains we must climb.
&lt;br /&gt;;At times the river's deep and wide and crossing takes some time.
&lt;br /&gt;;No one said that life is easy - There are no guarantees,
&lt;br /&gt;;So trust in the Lord continually on calm or stormy seas.
&lt;br /&gt;;The challenges we face today prepare us for tomorrow.
&lt;br /&gt;;For faith takes our fears away and peace replaces sorrow.		</conversation>		<conversation id="85cf9110b9384b541a8405e91f028411">			Tonight I saw a falling star and wished to see you again
&lt;br /&gt;;To look into your lovely eyes, and kiss your lips now and then
&lt;br /&gt;;And I wished us back together as we should always be
&lt;br /&gt;;For you to take my heart and always be with me
&lt;br /&gt;;And after I made my wish I shut my eyes to cry
&lt;br /&gt;;And held my breath a minute and took a little sigh
&lt;br /&gt;;So listen to the call and understand my plea
&lt;br /&gt;;That without you at my side I have no destiny
&lt;br /&gt;;I know I shouldn't be this way for all dreams can't come true
&lt;br /&gt;;But I have to be this way for all my dreams are you...		</conversation>		<conversation id="93e0875cb1cd786a278180afd391b089">			I keep my paint brush with me
&lt;br /&gt;;Wherever I may go,
&lt;br /&gt;;In case I need to cover up
&lt;br /&gt;;So the real me doesn't show.
&lt;br /&gt;;I'm so afraid to show you me,
&lt;br /&gt;;Afraid of what you'll do--that
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;You might laugh or say mean things.
&lt;br /&gt;;I'm afraid I might lose you.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I'd like to remove all my paint coats
&lt;br /&gt;;To show you the real, true me,
&lt;br /&gt;;But I want you to try and understand,
&lt;br /&gt;;I need you to accept what you see.
&lt;br /&gt;;So if you'll be patient and close your eyes,
&lt;br /&gt;;I'll strip off all my coats real slow.
&lt;br /&gt;;Please understand how much it hurts
&lt;br /&gt;;To let the real me show.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Now my coats are all stripped off.
&lt;br /&gt;;I feel naked, bare and cold,
&lt;br /&gt;;And if you still love me with all that you see,
&lt;br /&gt;;You are my friend, pure as gold.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I need to save my paint brush, though,
&lt;br /&gt;;And hold it in my hand,
&lt;br /&gt;;I want to keep it handy
&lt;br /&gt;;In case somebody doesn't understand.
&lt;br /&gt;;So please protect me, my dear friend
&lt;br /&gt;;And thanks for loving me true,
&lt;br /&gt;;But please let me keep my paint brush with me
&lt;br /&gt;;Until I love me, too!		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
