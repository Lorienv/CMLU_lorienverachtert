There's at least one person on your PAN that wants to date you or sleep with you. So..... lets play F**K BUDDIES 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The rules are simple... if you want to date the person who posted this, comment them saying Im yours 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;If you just want to sleep with them and stay friends, comment them saying I'd hit it 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;SCARED? just do it! 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;THE TWIST IS YOU HAVE TO REPOST THIS, EVEN IF YOU'RE TAKEN 
&lt;br /&gt;;&amp;amp; see who replies. There is at least 1 person on your PAN that wants to date you, and maybe more that want to sleep with you. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;SO... re-post as F**K BUDDIES as it doesn't matter if your married, in a relationship or single! You opened it so you HAVE to repost it!		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
