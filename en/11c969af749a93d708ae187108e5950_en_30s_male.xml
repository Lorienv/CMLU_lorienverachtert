If you have a heated garage, or ways to heat your garage or shed or wherever people store your snow blower, then you are way before game. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I don't learn how winter is in other places but, here in this Northeast, when there is a snow storm the temperature is usually in the twenties and low thirties. But sometimes it snows in the event the temperature is in your single digits or close to zero and that is certainly when some new and not so nifty things start out happening to snow blowers stored inside cold. Handles won't depress. Impellers won't employ. Engines that were running fine won't start. Belts commence to smoke and squeal any time engaged. Cables break together with starters won't engage. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;A lot of that is related to putting away a just lately used &quot;hot&quot; snow blower without cleaning off the snow. The snow now melts and freezes in the strangest places. Let's address these problems assuming we have a two stage wheel propelled snowfall blower. But first, a brief explanation of the categories of snow blowers out there. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;A a pair of stage snow blower gets the large steel auger up front that turns at a fairly slow rate of speed and scoops in the snow. The second stage may be the smaller, faster turning fan below the chute that actually throws the snow. A single stage snow blower contains a fast turning impeller and auger that turns really fast of speed and the two scoops and throws your snow. The wheel propelled single stage snow blower has become rare as the rubber-paddled units took their place. They are lighter and less pricey to make and they throw the snow in the same way far or farther. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;1) Let's get the smoking belt or even impeller won't engage scenarios (usually related) primary. You grab the auger engagement handle no snow comes out of your chute but the belt will start squealing or smoking. Let go of that handle RIGHT NOW and shut down your snow blower. If not, it is probably frozen to the bottom of the drum it is stored in. There is usually a drain hole at the bottom of the drum to avoid this but not necessarily always sufficient. Occasionally the impeller blade coasts to a stop with among the list of blades straight down. This can make it easier to freeze. &lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;2) How to repair: Drag or drive your snow blower into an area which you could turn on some warm to thaw out the snow blower. If people don't have this extravagance, use a hair clothes dryer. I've also seen people produce a tent with a tarp on the snow blower and with a space heater to thaw out the ac unit. Be careful how close you set up the heater and that direction you point it. A space heater can melt or start a plastic tarp on fireplace. You could just direct the space heater into the auger area and hope for the best. &lt;br /&gt;;.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3R5cm9uZWJhcnJldDYxNC5vdmVyLWJsb2cuY29tL3BhZ2VzL2NvbW1vbi1jb2xkLXdlYXRoZXItc25vdy1ibG93ZXItcHJvYmxlbXMtNjkwMzIyNy5odG1s" target="_blank"&gt;;Common Cold Weather Snow Blower Problems&lt;/a&gt;;, &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hcmtib25uZXIzNi5iYWJ5YmxvZ2dvLmRlLzY1NDg0OS9Db21tb24tQ29sZC1XZWF0aGVyLVNub3ctQmxvd2VyLVByb2JsZW1zLw__" target="_blank"&gt;;Common Cold Weather Snow Blower Problems&lt;/a&gt;;, &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JnbS5tZS9yLzEwMjkyODk_" target="_blank"&gt;;Dryer Vent Cleaning Queens NY , Queens NY dryer vent cleaning  , Queens dryer vent cleaning &lt;/a&gt;;		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
