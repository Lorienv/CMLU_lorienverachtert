Instead we can rely on a set of nicely-utilized presentation strategies for retaining our viewers engaged. Here are the prime ten methods that we have accessible:&lt;br&gt;;&lt;ol&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;li&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;strong&gt;;Explain to them technique&lt;/strong&gt;;. Many presenters price the usefulness of the Notify them method. It has three major components. The very first phase involves us telling our viewers what we are about to tell them, the 2nd stage has us telling the audience and the 3rd and final stage requires us telling the audience what we have just instructed them. Easy in fact. Efficiently it is a repetition strategy and something that has echoes in numerous other rhetorical units.&lt;/li&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;    &lt;li&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;strong&gt;;Stepping stone or way marker approach&lt;/strong&gt;;. The moment we have prepared the working aims for our presentation it must be extremely effortless to use this strategy. It will involve us plotting stepping stones or markers that quickly determine in which we are in a presentation. Our principal presentation factors are plotted at the starting and the end of our presentation structure. Our two lesser points are then plotted involving them -- effectively bridging the two main factors. By next the reasonable methods we access the conclusion.&lt;/li&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;    &lt;li&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;strong&gt;;Acrostic technique&lt;/strong&gt;;.  This appears unpleasant but is in truth incredibly simple to put together. It is a strategy, utilised by numerous speakers, that dates back again millennia -- certainly to the ancient Greeks. Employing what is in essence a word puzzle the speaker employs a approach for spelling out the design of a presentation in addition its important defining factors. Working with both the 1st, middle, very last or consecutive letters of a phrase in a line will allow the speaker to spell out a main concept.

This approach could be paraphrased as the what, so what, now what technique.
