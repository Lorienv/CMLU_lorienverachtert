&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;I am Major Jerry Hill,a senior security officer in charge of arms and ammunition of Charles Taylor troops. I and three officers were assigned to purchase arms and ammunition in France, on getting to Ghana, we heard a news that U.S.A. President had given an ultimatum for our president, Charles Taylor (Former) to leave the country for a political asylum with immediate effect. Few months ago, He was arrested by the Nigeria Government and handed over to the UN to face war crimes in the
&lt;br /&gt;;International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague Netherlands.
