&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Watch Jersey Shore Season 5 Episode 9 The Truth Will Set You Free.We haven’t even seen tonight’s Jersey Shore (Season 5, Episode 8: “Sharp Objects”) yet, but already there are spoilers for next week’s episode, Season 5, Episode 9: “The Truth Will Set You Free”.Watch Video Online Jersey Shore Season 5 Episode 9 1March Youtube Free live stream Online VIDEO MTV Watch Pilot Episode For Free Trailer and Preview of 1 March 2012 Cast Crew Pictures and Wallpapers.Online Watch Jersey Shore Episode Full On MTV 1 March 2012 English Drama Serial.

&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2FoPY0G"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://goo.gl/oPY0G&lt;/a&gt;;
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;“The Situation's sidekick and pot-stirring friend Jonnny 'The Unit' is back from his trip to Miami and back on Jersey Shore doing what he does best...causing trouble,” Examiner reports. We know that Mike called him for help in backing up his Snooki hook-up claims in recent episodes, so maybe this confrontation he’s been teasing all season long will finally occur.
&lt;br /&gt;;This, however, scares us way more: “With the rest of their roommates attached, Deena, Pauly, and Vinny struggle as the only single castmates.”
&lt;br /&gt;;Okay: Snooki has Jionni, Sammi has Ronnie (at least until filming ended), JWOWW has Roger...but that leaves The Situation. Does that mean Mike will finally make an honest woman out of Paula?		</conversation>		<conversation id="ce1a23cd32cef3c10031e1807cbf1c09">			&lt;strong&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2FrSNcj"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://goo.gl/rSNcj&lt;/a&gt;;
