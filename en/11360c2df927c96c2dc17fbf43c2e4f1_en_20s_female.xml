Prebiotics are certainly not talked about as much. If you are interested in your digestion system you must spend a bit of time understanding these two terms.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;When you think about yogurt do you automatically think about the good bacteria in your instinct that you expect to get through eating some of the many types that are in the marketplace?
