&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Dear Tech Support,
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and I noticed a distinct slowdown in the overall system performance, particularly in the flower and jewelery applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5, and then installed undesirable programs such as NEWS 5.0, MONEY 3.0 and CRICKET 4.1 .
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Please note that I have tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do?
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Signed,

&lt;br /&gt;;REPLY
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;DEAR Madam,
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;First, keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Please enter command: ithoughtyoulovedme. HTML and try to download Tears 6.2 and do not forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update.
&lt;br /&gt;;If that application works as designed, Husband1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewellery 2.0 and Flowers 3.5..
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;However, remember, overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Silence 2.5 or Beer 6.1.
&lt;br /&gt;;Please note that Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Whatever you do, DO NOT in any circumstances install Mother-In-Law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources.)
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;In addition, please do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software
&lt;br /&gt;;To improve memory and performance.
&lt;br /&gt;;We recommend: Cooking 3.0 and Good Looks 7.7.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Good Luck Madam!&lt;/div&gt;;
