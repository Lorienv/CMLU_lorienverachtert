It was surprising not because of its content but how fast its content was implemented. This article can be related to a passage in the Bible in the book of Revelation chapter 13 ... he also force everyone, rich and poor, great and small, slave and free, to receive the mark on his right arm or forehead so that no one can buy or sell unless he had the mark which is the name of the beast or the number of his name... If what i am thinking is about to happen is about to begin, then my dear brethren, it is time we sit up and embrace the cross. May God be with us all.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
