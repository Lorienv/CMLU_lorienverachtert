But why worry? We have a God who is way bigger compare to all the problems that we may be facing.Sometimes what people say may hurt us but by the end of the day,its is out choice to absorb it or not. We have to learn to put God first in everything that we do and have faith in Him and Him alone that He can bring us through all this.No matter what,God will still be our comforter. He is our strength and hope.
&lt;br /&gt;          At times,as teenagers,we may try to find true love but we will never find it.Our God is our true love.Our first love.His love for us is unconditional.His love never fail.Some part of life we may find people spreading rumors bout us and make the world look down at and but that doesn't mean we must and have to look down at ourself.It doesn't matter how the world look at us.By the end of the day,Is about our relationship with God. God love us and His love will never end.  
&lt;br /&gt;         Each an everyone of us belong to Jesus and we are all His beloved children.No one can tear us apart from God.Most of all,don't ever do silly things that may harm yourself. Is just not worth it at all. There is no problem too BIG for our God to solve.Our God is always waiting for us to turn to Him.We just have to communicate with him daily to build a stronger relationship.He has a future that will prosper us and not harm us. Dont ever look down at yourself and start loving yourself from now on.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
