&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;India is a subcontinent but we spend less than one percent of our GDP on health. It is natural that our economic growth would be impeded and the poor would remain under the poverty line. Dr. Mishra's intiative to operate free those patient was appreciated all over world.

Aside from the free cost of surgery, the patients were also provided free medicines, free foods and free transportation.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
