With an official notary of my local&lt;span class="textAlign" style="text-align: left;"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;; residence from the school, I got a library card right way, added with a key-ring size card with the number for convenience. With this card, I can check out as many as 30 books. Within 30 minutes, I check out three books required for Susan Jonas's Classic Plays by Women and Robert Vorlicky's Modern U.S. Drama. I'd start both courses tomorrow. In a sense it'd be my first school life day at NYU then. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;It's only been my 11th day in NYC. I am already so impressed by the kind of public service I can get either at school or in town. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Walking from the midtown library to NYU, however, seems so much harder&lt;img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /&gt;;.  Could have waited for MS 5 or 1, but they never seem to be around due to rarer frequency between 2:00 to 5:00 PM. The walk itself however is very good. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;More reading ahead~~ Good to become wiser, isn't it?		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
