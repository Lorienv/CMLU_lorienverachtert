I like to believe that there is a way for everyone in the world to connect with one another. I guess the way that I view life has an impact on who I am and what I do.  I love dancing, especially salsa and cumbias, but also enjoy romantic, quiet evenings. On my free time I go for jogs, listen to live music, cook and eat at different restaurants. I'm into all kinds of music, but usually listen to alternative rock or Spanish, I'm looking for a man who is confident about himself and not intimidated by an educated mujer. It would be great to meet a guy who is politically conscious and who is not afraid to defend his views. I prefer a man who is independent, but who doesn't mind my company once in a while. Your career should involve something that you love to do and you should be the type who is always looking for new ways to advance yourself.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
