This has been a reality for a while now and it is a lot more so with the recent Google Panda update which impacted even a few high profile websites. When it comes to ranking in Google link building is nothing new. In fact this method was around even before other SEO strategies. Quality inbound links had been the first &quot;search engine&quot; - good sites with high-quality content spread by word of mouth.  Google along with other search engines depend upon the quality and quantity of inbound links when they select which websites to show in their results. Below are a few reasons why you have to include link building as an element of your technique if you're looking to boost your ranking in the search engines.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;How Inbound Links Enhance Google Rankings&lt;br /&gt;;If you consider the World Wide Web as a huge road map and your website as a small space on that map then your search engine marketing strategy is going to be employed to entice visitors to that place you're located. In this scenario the inbound links behave like road signs on the highway pointing the way for Google spiders and other visitors to find their way to your site. The Google spiderâ€™s duty is to crawl the web and make an index of all the webpages they find.&lt;br /&gt;;Ideally, the more links - road signs - which point to your website, the better it is for your search engine ranking. Nevertheless, there are a few problems with this scenario. It's far too easy to manipulate the function that links play in directing the search engine bots at your site to boost search engine ranking artificially. That's why a lot of search engines use an algorithm to determine what those links say about your site.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;In a perfect world a great deal of inboud links would mean that the content on your site has been helpful to many visitors. Years ago the search engines determined that if people discovered your content and linked to it it must suggest that there is something there that's worth reading. To ensure that the results which they present to individuals are strongly related to their query the search engines determine how many links to your site are about the same thing. For example if you look for scrapbooking, Google will verify how many sites link back to your site for scrapbooking before they display the results.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Google also may include links to your website in their calculation of Page Rank, which ascertains how high in the results page your website will be listed. The more relevant links pointing back to your website, the higher your page rank is likely to be - and higher page rank is always better.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;As you can see, link building is an essential part of your mission to enhance search engine rankings, but it needs to be smart link building. When you include a link building campaign as an element of an overall SEO strategy to boost your rankings and visibility in Google's results, you'll improve your chances of an effective campaign.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;If you're looking for fast and effective &lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mandloys.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;;http://www.mandloys.com&lt;/a&gt;; , contact MandLoys Online Marketing today!		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
