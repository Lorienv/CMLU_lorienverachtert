Daniel Lloyd Fiscus pled not liable to one count involving solicitation to commit first-degree murder. The 51-year-old was charged on Friday, and consistent with prosecutors, he was disappointed with his wife because she started out divorce proceedings toward him lately. Fiscus supposedly gave a co-employee $4, 000 to hire a hit man to obliterate her. In the midst of an interview with investigators, Fiscus in the beginning said the money hasn't been for a hired killer then again he said that he had made an error and was now in a messy position. He then proceeded to explain that he really didn't want his wife destroyed. Fiscusâ??s bail was originally set at $5 million but then on Monday, Court Commissioner Patrick Oishin changed that end up $20 million due to help Fiscusâ??s income, real estate holdings, and the temperament in the crime.&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9uZGl2b3JjZS5jb20_" target="_blank"&gt;;Washington Divorce&lt;/a&gt;;		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
