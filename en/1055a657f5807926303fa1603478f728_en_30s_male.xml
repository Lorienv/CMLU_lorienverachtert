Consequently, provisions have been put in place by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for citizens, who feel they have been aggrieved or disenfranchised in the on-going elections to seek redress. We encourage all those who feel that their votes did not count to turn to the tribunals to legally defend their votes.		</conversation>		<conversation id="973a6fee279b181620c6e0b545cc4a65">			Though widely shared, that sentiment has not silenced the general dissatisfaction. If anything, it has grown louder as reform plans take shape and the rascal ways of the political class are unmistakably identified as the main reason for the lack of prosperity. The economy may be growing by 7% a year, but this feeds mostly the greedy mouths closest to government troughs. The speaker of the lower house of parliament was investigated this month for “misappropriating” $140m. Meanwhile, about 70% of Nigerians live on less than $2 a day.		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
