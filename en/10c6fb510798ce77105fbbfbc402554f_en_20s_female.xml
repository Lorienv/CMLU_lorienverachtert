It seems to be easy to say in words but actually I cannot. I keep a cold face, ignore you and say bad words to you. You be hurted by me and I also by myself.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find another for my position in your heart. I shall feel disillusioned and in empty space if you find out her. But I really be happy and find the peace for my soul. I'm so sorry for i has stolen your heart and your all sky. If one chance for the past, I would never put me in your eyes. Hope you find again your own sky!		</conversation>	</conversations></author>
