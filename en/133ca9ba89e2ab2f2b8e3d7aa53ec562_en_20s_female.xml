For some reason though I can't. It makes me crazy though cause I'm like a closet neat freak. In the same breath though I'm a slob. Crazy, I know. I want a maid though. But as much as I hate and like cleaning I can't stand doing the dishes. Oh well, I guess I will just go clean the house. I can't put if off any longer.
