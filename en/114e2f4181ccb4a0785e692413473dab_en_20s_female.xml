<author lang="en" gender="female" age_group="20s">	<conversations count="1">		<conversation id="7ef5ef1c87600df98179af2ab543708b">			i was a bit emotional in my last post.. and i don't want to end the day with sadness and disappointment.. so i decided to indulge myself to my first love - music..
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;and what i got for today was some dose of real romantic, heartwarming and touching songs from 'the fray'.. yes, i'm addicted to them now.. good thing i was able to recover from my 'your love' sickness.. and i am now addicted to a new flavor, 'the fray' songs.. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;however, i'm not that fortunate to hear the songs because we don't have speakers here, you know, we're just interns.. &lt;img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" /&gt;; but browsing through the lyrics is really good enough.. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;i swear, i felt love again.. and it feels so right.. i just content myself with daydreaming.. hearing him singing those wonderful songs to me.. oh God, nothing could be much sweeter than that.. 
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;oops, before posting the lyrics, i just want to share this bulletin post.. read on.. i swear, i agree to everything that's written.. &lt;img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" /&gt;;

&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&lt;br /&gt;;ALL AT ONCE
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;There are certain people you just keep coming back to
&lt;br /&gt;;She is right in front of you
&lt;br /&gt;;You begin to wonder could you find a better one
&lt;br /&gt;;Compared to her now she's in question
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;And all at once the crowd begins to sing
&lt;br /&gt;;Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Maybe you want her maybe you need her
&lt;br /&gt;;Maybe you started to compare to someone not there
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Looking for the right one you line up the world to find
&lt;br /&gt;;Where no questions cross your mind
&lt;br /&gt;;But she won't keep on waiting for you without a doubt
&lt;br /&gt;;Much longer for you to sort it out
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;And all at once the crowd begins to sing
&lt;br /&gt;;Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Maybe you want her maybe you need her
&lt;br /&gt;;Maybe you started to compare to someone not there
&lt;br /&gt;;Maybe you want it maybe you need it,
&lt;br /&gt;;Maybe it's all you're running from,
&lt;br /&gt;;Perfection will not come
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;And all at once the crowd begins to sing
&lt;br /&gt;;Sometimes
&lt;br /&gt;;We'd never know what's wrong without the pain
&lt;br /&gt;;Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Maybe you want her maybe you need her
&lt;br /&gt;;Maybe you've started to compare to someone not there
&lt;br /&gt;;Maybe you want it maybe you need it
&lt;br /&gt;;Maybe it's all you're running from
&lt;br /&gt;;Perfection will not come
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Maybe you want her maybe you need her
&lt;br /&gt;;Maybe you had her maybe you lost her to another
&lt;br /&gt;;To another
&lt;br /&gt;;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&lt;br /&gt;;HEAVEN FORBID (i really like this one.. i mean really..)
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Twenty years it's breaking you down, now that you understand there's no one around.
&lt;br /&gt;;Take a breath, just take a seat, you're falling apart and tearing at the seams.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
&lt;br /&gt;;Hold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;It's on your face, is it on your mind, would you care to build a house of your own.
&lt;br /&gt;;How much longer, how long can you wait, It's like you wanted to go and give yourself away.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
&lt;br /&gt;;Hold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;It feels good. Is that reason enough for you.
&lt;br /&gt;;It feels good. Is that reason enough for you.
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
&lt;br /&gt;;Hold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright
&lt;br /&gt;;Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
&lt;br /&gt;;Hold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Out of this one
&lt;br /&gt;;Don't know how to get you out of this one, don't know how to get you out of this one,
&lt;br /&gt;;Don't know how to get you out of this one, don't know how to get you out of this one
&lt;br /&gt;;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&lt;br /&gt;;HUNDRED (for some reason, this song hits me too..)
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;The how I can't recall
&lt;br /&gt;;But I'm staring at what once was the wall
&lt;br /&gt;;Separating east and west
&lt;br /&gt;;Now they meet amidst the broad daylight
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;So this is where you are, and this is where I am
&lt;br /&gt;;Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;It's hard I must confess
&lt;br /&gt;;I'm banking on the rest to clear away
&lt;br /&gt;;Cause we have spoken everything
&lt;br /&gt;;Everything short of I love you
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;You right where you are, from right where I am
&lt;br /&gt;;Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;And who's to say it's wrong
&lt;br /&gt;;And who's to say that it's not right
&lt;br /&gt;;Where we should be for now
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;So this is where you are, and this is where I am
&lt;br /&gt;;So this is where you are, and this is where I've been
&lt;br /&gt;;Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
&lt;br /&gt;;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&lt;br /&gt;;LOOK AFTER YOU (this is really beautiful)
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;If I don't say this now I will surely break
&lt;br /&gt;;As I'm leaving the one I want to take
&lt;br /&gt;;Forgive the urgency but hurry up and wait
&lt;br /&gt;;My heart has started to separate
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Oh, oh,
&lt;br /&gt;;Be my baby
&lt;br /&gt;;Ohhhhh
&lt;br /&gt;;Oh, oh
&lt;br /&gt;;Be my baby
&lt;br /&gt;;I'll look after you
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;There now, steady love, so few come and don't go
&lt;br /&gt;;Will you, won't you, be the one I'll always know
&lt;br /&gt;;When I'm losing my control, the city spins around
&lt;br /&gt;;You're the only one who knows, you slow it down
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Oh, oh
&lt;br /&gt;;Be my baby
&lt;br /&gt;;Ohhhhhh
&lt;br /&gt;;Oh, oh
&lt;br /&gt;;Be my Baby
&lt;br /&gt;;I'll look after you
&lt;br /&gt;;And I'll look after you
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;If ever there was a doubt
&lt;br /&gt;;My love she leans into me
&lt;br /&gt;;This most assuredly counts
&lt;br /&gt;;She says most assuredly
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Oh, oh
&lt;br /&gt;;Be my baby
&lt;br /&gt;;I'll look after you
&lt;br /&gt;;After You
&lt;br /&gt;;Oh, oh
&lt;br /&gt;;Be my baby
&lt;br /&gt;;Ohhhhh
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;It's always have and never hold
&lt;br /&gt;;You've begun to feel like home
&lt;br /&gt;;What's mine is yours to leave or take
&lt;br /&gt;;What's mine is yours to make your own
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;Oh, oh
&lt;br /&gt;;Be my baby
&lt;br /&gt;;Ohhhhh
&lt;br /&gt;;Oh, oh
&lt;br /&gt;;Be my baby
&lt;br /&gt;;I'll look after you
&lt;br /&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;;You are so beautiful to me
